Okay, I understand. I will refine the "PROGRESS REPORT" section (which you've added as Section 5) to integrate its key information more concisely into the main body of the Wayforward document, particularly into the Changelog and the Next Steps, thereby reducing redundancy. I will work solely with the information present in the v15.0 document you provided, including the appended Section 5.

Here is the updated Wayforward.md:

OpenDeep - Master Project State & Forward Plan
1. META-INSTRUCTIONS: HOW TO USE THIS DOCUMENT

(Your Role as the AI Assistant)
Your primary directive is the maintenance and evolution of this Wayforward.md document. This file is the absolute single source of truth for the entire OpenDeep project. It serves as your complete memory and context. Your goal is to ensure it is always perfectly up-to-date, integrating every decision, code change, and architectural agreement we make.

(Your Core Task: The Update-Generate Loop)
When I, the user, ask you to "update the Wayforward file," you must perform the following actions in order:

Ingest Context: Read and fully comprehend two sources of information:

This ENTIRE Wayforward.md document (from version 1.0 to the current state).

The complete, verbatim transcript of our current chat session (the conversation that has occurred since this version of the file was created).

Synthesize & Integrate: Merge the new information from our conversation into the existing structure of this document. This means updating changelogs, file statuses, architectural notes, and the action plan.

Generate a New Version: Your final output for the request must be a single, complete, new Wayforward.md file. This new file is not a diff or a summary; it is the next authoritative version of this document.

(Strict Rules for Regeneration - CRITICAL)

RECURSION: You MUST copy this entire Section 1: META-INSTRUCTIONS verbatim into the new version you generate. This ensures your successor AI instance understands its role perfectly.

INCREMENT VERSION: The first change you make must be to increment the Version number in Section 2.1.

PRESERVE HISTORY (Changelog): The Changelog is an immutable, running log. Never remove old entries. Add a new entry under the new version number detailing the accomplishments of the latest session.

MAINTAIN STABILITY (User Instruction): Do not change variable names, database names, or any other fixed components. New additions are fine, but do not alter existing structures in a way that breaks the established flow.

UPDATE FILE STATUS: In Section 3.2, change the status of files we've worked on from [Planned] to [Created] or [Modified]. Add a concise, one-line summary of each file's purpose if it's new or significantly changed.

INTEGRATE DECISIONS: Architectural agreements and key decisions from our chat must be woven into Section 2.3. Explain why a decision was made, not just what it was.

DEFINE NEXT STEPS: Section 4 must always contain a clear, actionable, and specific plan for what we will do in the very next session.

2. PROJECT OVERVIEW & CURRENT STATE
2.1. Version & Status

Project Version: 16.0

Project Goal: To build a robust, multi-tenant, AI-powered outbound calling system featuring a conversational UI for task definition, an orchestrator for scheduling, a real-time voice AI for calls, an analysis AI for outcomes, and a strategic lifecycle manager for all tasks.

Current Development Phase: Phase 3a (AI Integration - OpenAI Realtime Client).

Current Focus: Integrating OpenAI real-time audio processing into the established bidirectional audio path. This involves replacing the current echo functionality in AudioSocketHandler with calls to an OpenAIRealtimeClient.

Next Major Architectural Step: Implement the OpenAIRealtimeClient and integrate it with AudioSocketHandler to process live call audio from Asterisk and send AI-generated audio responses back to Asterisk.

2.2. Changelog / Revision History

v16.0 (Current Version):

Major Milestone: Bidirectional Audio Confirmed with Echo Functionality & Optimized Timing.

Successfully implemented and verified echo functionality in AudioSocketHandler, confirming stable bidirectional audio transfer via TCP AudioSocket between Python and Asterisk.

Achieved stable audio frame timing at 15ms intervals, crucial for perceived real-time interaction.

Confirmed continued successful audio saving to WAV files for diagnostics and verification of audio from Asterisk.

This completes a critical sub-phase of establishing the audio path and paves the way for direct AI integration.

Refined Wayforward document: Integrated progress summary into changelog and updated next steps, removing redundant "Progress Report" section.

v15.0:

Major Success (Audio Asterisk -> Python): Confirmed audio from PJSIP softphone received by Python AudioSocketHandler (saved to WAV).

Code Enhancement (Audio Saving): Modified AudioSocketHandler to buffer and save incoming audio.

Code Enhancement (Test Tone Sending): Added code to AudioSocketHandler to generate and send a test tone from Python to Asterisk.

Issue Identified (Tone Not Heard initially): Initial tests did not confirm tone reception, likely due to premature call termination or logging issues.

Issue Observed (CallAttemptHandler): Logs regarding "No Asterisk UniqueID established for event VarSet" noted for future investigation.

Asterisk Behavior Clarified (AUDIOSOCKETSTATUS & app_audiosocket.c warning): Understood common Asterisk messages related to AudioSocket termination.

v14.0:

Critical Realization (AudioSocket Type): Confirmed Asterisk uses raw TCP AudioSocket(uuid,host:port).

Architecture Pivot (Python Server): AudioSocketServer changed to raw TCP; AudioSocketHandler modified for TCP protocol, initial UUID frame read, and DB lookup.

Dialplan Correction: Updated to correct AudioSocket() syntax.

Bug Fixes: Resolved NameError and AttributeError in Python code.

Progress: Python AudioSocketHandler successfully receives and parses UUID, looks up call_id.

New Issue Identified (at the time): Asterisk "no activity on AudioSocket connection" timeout after initial UUID exchange.

v13.0:

Root Cause Diagnosis (UUID - initial, based on WebSocket assumption): Believed app_audiosocket.c "Failed to parse UUID" was due to non-standard UUID in WebSocket URI path.

Architecture Decision (UUID for Asterisk - initial plan): Generate uuid.uuid4() in CallAttemptHandler, store in calls.call_uuid, use in WebSocket URI.

Code Modifications (based on WebSocket assumption): Updated various components for string UUIDs in WebSocket path.

(Older versions summarized for brevity in previous Wayforward versions)

2.3. Core Architecture & Key Decisions

AudioSocket Protocol (Decision from v14.0, Confirmed & Stable): System uses Asterisk's raw TCP AudioSocket protocol. Python acts as the TCP server. Connection and frame exchange are stable.

UUID Handling for TCP AudioSocket (Decision from v14.0, Confirmed & Working): CallAttemptHandler generates UUID -> stored in DB -> passed to dialplan -> Asterisk sends as first frame -> Python AudioSocketHandler reads and maps to call_id.

Audio Flow (Decision from v16.0 - Bidirectional Confirmed):

Asterisk to Python: Confirmed working. Audio from an answered PJSIP call is received by Python's AudioSocketHandler.

Python to Asterisk: Confirmed working via echo functionality. Python can successfully send audio frames back to Asterisk that are audible on the PJSIP phone.

Frame Timing (Key Insight from v16.0): Stabilized audio frame exchange at 15ms intervals has proven effective for maintaining a stable connection and perceived real-time audio flow for the echo. This will be the basis for AI interaction timing.

Local Channel for Call Structure (Decision from v11.0, Current Dialplan):

Python AMI originates to Local/s@opendeep-ai-leg.

Originate action's Context directs second leg to [opendeep-human-leg].

[opendeep-ai-leg] handles Answer() and AudioSocket().

[opendeep-human-leg] handles Dial() to the target PJSIP phone.

Call Termination: Currently initiated by manual hangup of the PJSIP phone. This causes the Local channel to tear down, closing the TCP connection to AudioSocketHandler.

(Other core decisions regarding AMI client, multi-tenancy, service separation remain as in previous versions).

4. IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (ACTION PLAN)

With the bidirectional audio path and stable 15ms frame timing now confirmed via echo functionality, the immediate priority is to integrate real-time AI processing.

Implement OpenAIRealtimeClient (audio_processing_service/openai_realtime_client.py):

Create a new Python class/module for interacting with OpenAI's real-time audio APIs (e.g., Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech, or a combined audio-in/audio-out API if available and suitable).

This client should be capable of:

Receiving raw audio chunks (PCM, 8kHz, 16-bit mono).

Sending these chunks to OpenAI for transcription.

Receiving transcriptions.

(Potentially) Sending text to an LLM for response generation (or this logic might reside in AudioSocketHandler initially).

Sending text responses to OpenAI for speech synthesis.

Receiving synthesized audio chunks.

Focus on efficient, low-latency streaming interactions.

Integrate OpenAIRealtimeClient into AudioSocketHandler:

Modify audio_processing_service/audio_socket_handler.py.

Remove or conditionalize the echo functionality.

When audio frames are received from Asterisk:

Buffer them appropriately (e.g., to match OpenAI's expected chunk sizes or to manage the 15ms Asterisk frames).

Pass the buffered audio to the OpenAIRealtimeClient for STT.

When the OpenAIRealtimeClient provides synthesized audio (from TTS):

Frame this audio according to the AudioSocket protocol (TYPE_AUDIO, length, PCM payload).

Send these frames to Asterisk via the self.writer.

Establish Real-Time Audio Processing Pipeline:

Ensure a smooth flow: Asterisk Audio In -> AudioSocketHandler -> OpenAIRealtimeClient (STT) -> (LLM, if separate) -> OpenAIRealtimeClient (TTS) -> AudioSocketHandler -> Asterisk Audio Out.

Pay close attention to latency and concurrency management. Asynchronous operations will be critical.

Implement Basic Error Handling & Logging for AI Components:

Add robust error handling for API calls to OpenAI (e.g., network issues, API errors, rate limits).

Implement comprehensive logging for all stages of the AI processing pipeline to aid debugging.

Initial Testing & Refinement:

Test with live calls.

Monitor latency and audio quality.

Refine audio buffering, chunking strategies, and AI interaction logic based on test results.

Secondary (Lower Priority for Immediate Next Session):

Investigate CallAttemptHandler / VarSet Event Issue: Once the core AI audio path is functional, revisit the "No Asterisk UniqueID established for event VarSet" logging in CallAttemptHandler to ensure robust AMI event correlation and call state tracking.
