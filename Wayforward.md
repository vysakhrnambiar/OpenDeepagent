## 2. PROJECT OVERVIEW & CURRENT STATE

### 2.1. Version & Status

Project Version: 6.0

Project Goal: To build a robust, multi-tenant, AI-powered outbound calling system featuring a conversational UI for task definition, an orchestrator for scheduling, a real-time voice AI for calls, and an analysis AI for outcomes, with capabilities for Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) feedback.

Current Development Phase:
- Phase 1 (UI Foundation): Complete.
- Phase 1.5 (Fixes & Search Tool): Complete.
- Phase 1.6 (Authoritative Business Search & API Integration): Complete.
- Phase 2a (LLM Campaign Orchestration - UI Button & Backend Service): Complete.
- Next: Phase 2b (Task Execution Engine - Task Scheduler Service).

### 2.2. Changelog / Revision History

v6.0 (Current Version):
- Feature Complete (Phase 2a): Successfully implemented the OrchestratorService and the /api/execute_campaign endpoint. The "Confirm and Schedule Campaign" button in the UI now successfully triggers the creation of campaign and task records in the database.

- Core: Established base project structure, database schema, and FastAPI application.

### 2.3. Core Architecture & Key Decisions

Separation of Concerns (Orchestrator, Scheduler, Analyzer):
- Orchestrator (OrchestratorService): A one-time setup agent that takes the UI's final campaign_plan and creates database records. Once complete, its job is done for that plan.
- Scheduler (TaskSchedulerService): A persistent, long-running background process that polls for due tasks and initiates call attempts.
- Post-Call Analyzer (AnalysisService): A decision-making agent that analyzes call outcomes and determines next steps.

Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Feedback:
- Allows the Live Call AI to request immediate feedback from the UI user during active calls.
- Involves a request_user_feedback tool, WebSocket bridge, feedback_requests table, and enhancements to call handling components.

Multi-Tenancy & User Context:
- Core system uses user_id to associate campaigns and tasks, with username passed from UI to backend.
- Future plans include expanded user profiles to store preferences and reduce repetitive questioning.

Tool-Augmented AI:
- UIAssistantService uses a two-step tool-calling loop for factual queries.
- Specialized tools include get_authoritative_business_info for business data and search_internet for general information.

Modern API Usage:
- Deliberate use of Google Places API (New) via direct HTTP requests for reliability and future-proofing.

Task vs. Call Distinction:
- A Task is the overall objective defined by the user (e.g., "book a dentist appointment").
- A Call is an individual attempt to complete a Task. A single Task may involve multiple Call attempts.
- SQLite schema reflects this with tasks and calls tables.

Resilience and Error Handling:
- Handles unexpected call drops by logging errors and setting tasks for analysis.
- Implements retry logic with backoff for transient issues.
- Gracefully handles service failures across DB, Redis, and OpenAI dependencies.

Phase 2a (LLM Campaign Orchestration) is now COMPLETE. The UI allows plan creation, and the "Confirm and Schedule Campaign" button successfully triggers database record creation.

The next logical step is to implement Phase 2b: Building the Core Task Execution Engine, starting with the TaskSchedulerService.

Create task_manager/task_scheduler_svc.py:
- This will be a long-running background process.
- It will periodically poll the tasks table for due items (status='pending'/'on_hold', next_action_time in past, attempt_count < max).
- For each due task, it will update the task's status to 'in-progress' and log that it would initiate a call.
- Initially, this will be a standalone service. Later, it will trigger the CallInitiatorService (to be built after the Scheduler).


Okay, I will now update the Wayforward.md document.

I have processed our entire conversation since the last update (Version 6.0). I will integrate all the decisions regarding:

The precise mechanics of call concurrency and the roles of CallInitiatorService, AudioSocketServer/Handler, and CallAttemptHandler.

The introduction and planned functionality of the TaskLifecycleManagerService (our "Meta-OODA" agent), including its LLM-driven nature, its purview over all tasks, dynamic determination of long-running tasks, and proactive user check-ins.

The critical, pervasive principle of multi-tenancy for all new components and LLM interactions, ensuring data isolation.

The DND list handling clarification (confirming it's not what "OODA" referred to, but still important for the scheduler).

Please copy the entire content of my next message, as that will be the new Wayforward.md Version 7.0.

PROJECT OVERVIEW & CURRENT STATE

2.1. Version & Status

Project Version: 7.0

Project Goal: To build a robust, multi-tenant, AI-powered outbound calling system featuring a conversational UI for task definition, an orchestrator for scheduling, a real-time voice AI for calls, an analysis AI for outcomes, and a strategic lifecycle manager for all tasks, with capabilities for Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) feedback.

Current Development Phase:

Phase 1 (UI Foundation): Complete.
Phase 1.5 (Fixes & Search Tool): Complete.
Phase 1.6 (Authoritative Business Search & API Integration): Complete.
Phase 2a (LLM Campaign Orchestration - UI Button & Backend Service): Complete.
Next: Phase 2b (Task Execution Engine - Task Scheduler Service Implementation).

2.2. Changelog / Revision History

v7.0 (Current Version):

Architecture: Detailed the "Meta-OODA" agent, now named TaskLifecycleManagerService. Confirmed it will be a dedicated, LLM-driven service responsible for strategic oversight of all tasks (short and long-running), dynamic determination of task nature, proactive user check-ins for long tasks, and ensuring no collisions with PostCallAnalyzerService.
Architecture: Solidified the pervasive multi-tenancy design principle. All new services, database queries, and LLM interactions must be strictly scoped by user_id to ensure data isolation.
Architecture: Refined the understanding of call concurrency. CallInitiatorService enforces MAX_CONCURRENT_CALLS by managing how many CallAttemptHandler tasks are active. Each live call will have an AudioSocketHandler (spawned by AudioSocketServer upon Asterisk connection) and a corresponding CallAttemptHandler (managing AMI commands via Redis).
Architecture: Clarified that DND list checks are the responsibility of the TaskSchedulerService (pre-call) and PostCallAnalyzerService (post-call update). "OODA" does not refer to DND.
Planning: Confirmed that task prioritization will be a future enhancement involving database schema changes and logic updates in the TaskSchedulerService and OrchestratorService.

v6.0:

Feature Complete (Phase 2a): Successfully implemented the OrchestratorService and the /api/execute_campaign endpoint. The "Confirm and Schedule Campaign" button now creates campaign and task records.
Fixes: Resolved multiple TypeErrors, AttributeErrors, and NameErrors across UIAssistantService, OpenAIFormClient, and OrchestratorService related to function arguments, method existence, and imports. Corrected logic in get_authoritative_business_info to use direct HTTP calls.
Architecture: Initial detailed planning for Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) feedback. Clarified distinct roles of Orchestrator, Scheduler, and Post-Call Analyzer.

v5.0 - v1.0:
Resolved Google Cloud API issues, upgraded to modern Places API. Enhanced UI prompt with feedback loops and code-level validation. Implemented search tools (general and business-specific). Initial UI bug fixes, multi-tool support, multi-tenancy foundations, and base project structure.

2.3. Core Architecture & Key Decisions

Multi-Tenancy: A non-negotiable, foundational principle.
* Data Isolation: All key tables (users, campaigns, tasks, calls, call_transcripts, dnd_list, etc.) must include user_id. All database operations must be filtered by user_id.
* Service Design: All service methods operating on user-specific data must accept user_id and use it.
* LLM Context: Prompts and data fed to any LLM must be strictly scoped to the current user_id.

Separation of Concerns & Control Flow for Calls:
* TaskSchedulerService: Polls DB for due tasks (respecting user_id). Hands off to CallInitiatorService. Performs DND checks. (Future: will handle priority).
* CallInitiatorService: Gatekeeper for MAX_CONCURRENT_CALLS. If slot available, creates calls record, spawns a CallAttemptHandler task, and instructs AsteriskAmiClient to originate call (passing calls.id as channel variable).
* AudioSocketServer: Listens for Asterisk AudioSocket connections. Spawns an AudioSocketHandler task for each.
* AudioSocketHandler: Manages one live audio stream. Receives calls.id from Asterisk. Instantiates OpenAIRealtimeClient. Bridges audio. Publishes LLM-triggered commands (DTMF, end_call) to Redis channel call_commands:{calls.id}.
* CallAttemptHandler: Manages overall lifecycle for one calls.id. Subscribes to call_commands:{calls.id} on Redis. Uses AsteriskAmiClient to execute these commands. Monitors AMI for call end. Updates calls table.
* PostCallAnalyzerService: Reactive. Analyzes a single completed call attempt. Updates task status (success, fail, retry), suggests next steps, updates DND list if needed. Feeds data for the TaskLifecycleManagerService.
* TaskLifecycleManagerService (Meta-OODA Agent): Proactive & Strategic. LLM-driven.
* Oversees all tasks for all users (respecting user_id scoping).
* Monitors task queues, progress of long-running tasks, identifies stuck tasks.
* Dynamically determines task nature (long/short running).
* Decides on strategic adjustments (dynamic prioritization, prompt revisions, placing tasks on hold).
* Manages inter-call context for long-lived/phased tasks.
* Initiates proactive user check-ins for long-running tasks via UI.
* Acts by updating DB records, influencing the TaskSchedulerService.

Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Feedback: Planned. Allows Live Call AI to request immediate UI user feedback. Involves new AI tool, WebSocket bridge, feedback_requests DB table, and service enhancements.

Tool-Augmented UI Assistant: UIAssistantService uses a mandatory, two-step tool-calling loop for factual queries (Places API for business, Gemini for general).

Modern API Usage: Google Places API (New) via direct HTTP (httpx).

Task vs. Call: A task is the objective. A call (or call_attempt) is one phone call attempt for that task.

IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (ACTION PLAN)

Phase 2a (LLM Campaign Orchestration - UI Button & Backend Service) is COMPLETE.

The next concrete objective is to implement Phase 2b: Building the Core Task Execution Engine, starting with the TaskSchedulerService.

Create task_manager/task_scheduler_svc.py:

This service will be a long-running asyncio background process.

It will periodically poll the tasks table for tasks ready for action:

Query db_manager.get_due_tasks(user_id=None) (initially, it might poll for all users, or we can design it to manage tasks per user if sharding is ever needed, but for now, user_id filtering in the query is key). The query should consider status IN ('pending', 'on_hold', 'retry_scheduled'), next_action_time <= NOW(), current_attempt_count < max_attempts.

Multi-tenancy: Ensure user_id is fetched with task data.

DND Check: For each due task, it must call db_manager.is_on_dnd_list(phone_number, user_id). If DND, update task status to cancelled_dnd and skip.

Dispatch (Stubbed): For each valid due task, it will (for now) log that it would dispatch this task (including task_id and user_id) to the CallInitiatorService. The actual call to CallInitiatorService will be implemented once that service exists.

Update the task's status to processing_by_scheduler or queued_for_call in the database to prevent re-picking by the same scheduler poll.

Update database/db_manager.py:

Implement get_due_tasks() method with appropriate filtering and ordering (initially by next_action_time).

Implement is_on_dnd_list(phone_number, user_id).

Update main.py:

Instantiate TaskSchedulerService.

Add task_scheduler_svc.run_scheduler_loop() to the asyncio.gather() call in main_services() so it starts with the application.

This will give us the foundational loop that picks up scheduled tasks, respects DND, and is ready to hand them off for actual call initiation in the next step.

Okay, I understand. You've decided to proceed with Option 2 for AMI handling (Centralized py-asterisk AMI Handler in a Dedicated Thread + Async Wrapper). We will defer the actual implementation of this switch to the "next phase" after getting the current custom AsteriskAmiClient to successfully log in (or making one final attempt at that).

This Wayforward.md will reflect all our discussions, including this decision for AMI and the current state of development. This will be a good, clean state to restart our conversation from if needed.

I will now generate the complete Wayforward.md Version 9.0. Please copy the entire content of my next message.

2. PROJECT OVERVIEW & CURRENT STATE
2.1. Version & Status

Project Version: 9.0

Project Goal: To build a robust, multi-tenant, AI-powered outbound calling system featuring a conversational UI for task definition, an orchestrator for scheduling, a real-time voice AI for calls, an analysis AI for outcomes, and a strategic lifecycle manager for all tasks, with capabilities for Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) feedback.

Current Development Phase:

Phase 1 (UI Foundation): Complete.

Phase 1.5 (Fixes & Search Tool): Complete.

Phase 1.6 (Authoritative Business Search & API Integration): Complete.

Phase 2a (LLM Campaign Orchestration - UI Button & Backend Service): Complete.

Phase 2b (Task Execution Engine): Implementation of core services (TaskSchedulerService, CallInitiatorService, AsteriskAmiClient, CallAttemptHandler) in progress.

Current Focus: Debugging AMI login issue with the custom AsteriskAmiClient.

Next Major Architectural Step (Post AMI Login Debug): Refactor AMI interaction to use py-asterisk library in a dedicated thread with an async wrapper (Option 2 discussed).

2.2. Changelog / Revision History

v9.0 (Current Version):

Architecture Decision (AMI Client): Decided to pursue Option 2 for AMI handling: a centralized py-asterisk (the library from asterisk.ami) client running in a dedicated OS thread, with an async wrapper for the rest of the application. This change will be implemented in a subsequent phase after attempting to resolve the current login issue with the custom AsteriskAmiClient or making one final focused debugging pass on it.

Debugging Focus: Identified that the current AMI login failure with the custom AsteriskAmiClient is not due to Asterisk server-side configuration (manager.conf, users, permits) or credentials, as confirmed by a successful manual Telnet AMI login test using the same credentials and from the same application server IP. The issue lies within the Python AsteriskAmiClient's implementation or its interaction with asyncio streams during the login sequence.

Clarification (WebSockets & Threads): Confirmed that WebSockets for audio (Asterisk AudioSocket to app, app to OpenAI Realtime Voice/TTS) will be handled by asyncio tasks within the main event loop, not dedicated OS threads per WebSocket. The only dedicated OS thread under consideration is for wrapping the synchronous py-asterisk library.

File Updates:

database/models.py: Added app_config import to resolve NameError.

call_processor_service/asterisk_ami_client.py: Added datetime and uuid imports to resolve NameError in AmiAction.

main.py: Added typing.Optional import. Noted on_event deprecation for future refactoring to lifespan events.

Test Mode: Confirmed implementation details for "Test Mode" (redirecting calls to a specific number, forcing sequential execution) involving app_config settings and logic in CallInitiatorService and CallAttemptHandler. Noted .env variables needed for this.

v8.0:

Feature Started (Phase 2b): Created initial structure for task_manager/task_scheduler_svc.py.

Meta-Instruction Added: Permanent rule for AI to avoid changing fixed component names.

v7.0:

Architecture: Detailed TaskLifecycleManagerService. Solidified multi-tenancy. Refined call concurrency understanding. Clarified DND responsibility.

v6.0 - v1.0: (Summarized)
Completed Phase 2a (OrchestratorService). Multiple bug fixes. HITL planning. Google Places API integration. Search tools. UI enhancements and base project structure.

2.3. Core Architecture & Key Decisions

Stability Mandate: Do not change variable names, database names, or any other fixed components. New additions are fine, but do not alter existing structures in a way that breaks the established flow.

AMI Client Strategy (Decision from v9.0):

Current Path (Debug): Make one final focused attempt to debug the login issue with the existing custom asyncio-native AsteriskAmiClient.

Future Path (Refactor - Option 2): If the custom client login cannot be resolved quickly, the project will pivot to using the standard py-asterisk library (from asterisk.ami). This will involve:

Running a persistent py-asterisk.AMIClient instance in one (or a few) dedicated OS worker thread(s).

Creating an async wrapper class in the main application code. This wrapper will use thread-safe queues and asyncio.to_thread (or loop.run_in_executor) to pass AMI action requests to the worker thread and to receive AMI events from the worker thread back into the asyncio event loop.

CallAttemptHandler and other services will interact with this async wrapper.

Audio WebSockets (Decision from v9.0):

Incoming audio connections from Asterisk (via AudioSocket) and outgoing connections to OpenAI Realtime Voice (and any other TTS services) will be handled by native asyncio libraries (e.g., websockets).

Each live call's audio stream will be managed by an asyncio task (e.g., an AudioSocketHandler instance) without requiring a dedicated OS thread per WebSocket.

Multi-Tenancy: Foundational principle. Data isolation via user_id in DB tables and service logic. LLM context scoped by user_id. User-specific DND lists.

Separation of Concerns & Call Flow (High-Level):

TaskSchedulerService (asyncio task): Polls DB, DND checks, hands to CallInitiatorService.

CallInitiatorService (asyncio methods, called by Scheduler): Manages MAX_CONCURRENT_CALLS, creates calls DB record, spawns/starts CallAttemptHandler.

CallAttemptHandler (asyncio task, one per call attempt):

Manages AMI interaction for one call via the chosen AMI client strategy.

Instructs Asterisk to connect audio to AudioSocketServer.

Listens for commands from AudioSocketHandler via Redis.

Updates calls DB. Notifies CallInitiatorService on completion.

AudioSocketServer (asyncio task): Listens for AudioSocket connections from Asterisk.

AudioSocketHandler (asyncio task, one per live audio stream): Bridges audio between Asterisk and OpenAI. Publishes control commands to Redis.

PostCallAnalyzerService & TaskLifecycleManagerService: As previously defined.

Development & Testing Strategies (New from v8.0/v9.0):

Test Mode:

Activated by APP_TEST_MODE=True in .env.

All outbound calls redirected to APP_TEST_MODE_REDIRECT_NUMBER (e.g., "7000").

MAX_CONCURRENT_CALLS forced to 1 by CallInitiatorService.

Implemented by logic in CallInitiatorService (concurrency) and CallAttemptHandler (number redirection during Originate).

Iterative Testing: Aim for basic operational testing of components as they are integrated, before moving too many steps ahead, to catch issues early.

Future Improvements Noted:

Refactor FastAPI on_event("startup") and on_event("shutdown") to use modern "lifespan" events.

Transition database/db_manager.py to use a fully asynchronous database library (e.g., aiosqlite) for improved performance under high concurrency.

Implement global DND based on a threshold of user-specific DNDs.

Refactor of call_processor_service/asterisk_ami_client.py (or its replacement) to use py-asterisk via threads.

4. IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (ACTION PLAN)

The immediate priority is to resolve the AMI login failure with the current custom AsteriskAmiClient. The successful Telnet test indicates the issue is within our Python client's interaction.

Focused Debugging of AsteriskAmiClient.connect_and_login():

Scrutinize Banner Handling: Ensure the initial banner read (await self._reader.readuntil(b'\r\n')) is clean and doesn't interfere with subsequent reads/writes. Consider the small modification suggested previously (reading an extra byte with a tiny timeout after banner).

Raw Byte Logging: Temporarily log the raw bytes being written for the Login action and the raw bytes being read immediately after, before parsing. This might reveal subtle differences from what Telnet sends/receives (e.g., encoding nuances, extra characters, timing).

# In send_action, before self._writer.write()
action_bytes = str(action_obj) 
logger.debug(f"RAW AMI SEND (len {len(action_bytes)}): {action_bytes!r}") # !r shows escapes
self._writer.write(action_bytes)

# In _receive_loop, after data = await self._reader.readuntil(...)
logger.debug(f"RAW AMI RECV (len {len(data)}): {data!r}")


Simplify _receive_loop Temporarily (for login only): To diagnose the login response, temporarily make the _receive_loop only try to read and parse the login response (identified by ActionID) and log it, without yet trying to dispatch other events. This reduces complexity for this specific debug.

Timing: Experiment with a very small asyncio.sleep() (e.g., 0.05s) immediately after self._writer.drain() in send_action when sending the Login action, just to see if Asterisk needs a fractional moment (though it shouldn't).

Decision Point:

If the login issue with the custom AsteriskAmiClient can be fixed with these focused debugging steps (e.g., within 1-2 more sessions of effort), we proceed with the current client.

If it remains elusive and time-consuming, we pivot to implementing Option 2 for AMI handling: Refactor AsteriskAmiClient to be an async wrapper around py-asterisk (from asterisk.ami) running in a dedicated OS thread using asyncio.to_thread. This will leverage a known-good AMI protocol implementation.

Once AMI login is successful (either via fix or refactor), the immediate next step will be the initial integration test run as previously detailed:
* Run python main.py with Asterisk and Redis active.
* Use the UI or manually create a task in the DB.
* Observe logs and Asterisk CLI to see if TaskSchedulerService picks up the task, CallInitiatorService spawns CallAttemptHandler, and CallAttemptHandler successfully sends an Originate command to Asterisk, resulting in a call to the test extension 7000.

This plan prioritizes unblocking the critical AMI login.
