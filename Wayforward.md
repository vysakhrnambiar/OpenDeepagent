## 2. PROJECT OVERVIEW & CURRENT STATE

### 2.1. Version & Status

Project Version: 14.0

Project Goal: To build a robust, multi-tenant, AI-powered outbound calling system featuring a conversational UI for task definition, an orchestrator for scheduling, a real-time voice AI for calls, an analysis AI for outcomes, and a strategic lifecycle manager for all tasks.

Current Development Phase: Phase 2b (Task Execution Engine & Audio Path - TCP AudioSocket Integration).

Current Focus: Resolving Asterisk's "no activity on AudioSocket connection" timeout after the initial TCP connection and UUID exchange with the Python server. The phone is not ringing yet due to the AudioSocket leg failing.

Next Major Architectural Step: Achieve a stable, bi-directional audio stream between the softphone, Asterisk (via TCP AudioSocket), and the Python `AudioSocketHandler`.

### 2.2. Changelog / Revision History

v14.0 (Current Version):
- **Critical Realization (AudioSocket Type):** Confirmed via `core show application AudioSocket` that the Asterisk instance is using a **raw TCP version of `AudioSocket(uuid,host:port)`**, not a WebSocket version. This was a fundamental misunderstanding in previous approaches.
- **Architecture Pivot (Python Server):**
    - Modified `audio_processing_service/audio_socket_server.py` to be a raw TCP server, removing all WebSocket handshake logic.
    - Heavily modified `audio_processing_service/audio_socket_handler.py`:
        - `__init__` now only takes `reader, writer, redis_client, peername`. `call_id` and `asterisk_call_uuid` are determined after the first frame.
        - `handle_frames` now first reads and expects a `TYPE_UUID` frame from Asterisk, decodes the UUID, and uses it to look up the internal `call_id` via `db_manager.get_call_by_asterisk_uuid`.
        - Implemented a retry loop for the DB lookup of `asterisk_call_uuid` to handle potential timing issues with `CallAttemptHandler`'s DB update.
- **Dialplan Correction:** Updated `extensions.conf` (`[opendeep-ai-leg]`) to use the correct `AudioSocket(${ASTERISK_CALL_UUID},<IP>:<PORT>)` syntax for the TCP version.
- **Bug Fix (Python):** Resolved `NameError: name 'full_audiosocket_uri_with_call_id' is not defined` in `call_processor_service/call_attempt_handler.py` by removing unused variable definitions.
- **Bug Fix (Python):** Resolved `AttributeError: 'AppConfig' object has no attribute 'AUDIOSOCKET_READ_TIMEOUT_S'` by adding `AUDIOSOCKET_READ_TIMEOUT_S` to `config/app_config.py`.
- **Progress:**
    - Successfully established a raw TCP connection from Asterisk's `AudioSocket` application to the Python `AudioSocketServer`.
    - Python `AudioSocketHandler` successfully receives and parses the initial `TYPE_UUID` frame containing the `asterisk_call_uuid` sent by Asterisk.
    - Python `AudioSocketHandler` successfully uses this UUID to look up the internal `call_id` from the database (with retry logic proving effective).
    - Python `AudioSocketHandler` updates the call status to `LIVE_AI_HANDLING` and attempts to send an empty audio frame back to Asterisk.
- **New Issue Identified:** Despite Python sending an empty audio frame, Asterisk still times out with "Reached timeout after 2000 ms of no activity on AudioSocket connection." This causes the `AudioSocket` leg to fail, and consequently, the `Dial()` on the other leg of the `Local` channel does not proceed long enough for the phone to be answered (results in a missed call). The Python handler sees the connection drop as "0 bytes read on a total of 3 expected bytes" when trying to read the next frame.

v13.0:
- **Root Cause Diagnosis (UUID):** Identified that `app_audiosocket.c` (WebSocket version assumption at the time) was erroring with "Failed to parse UUID" because the URI's path component (our integer `call_id`) was not a standard UUID.
- **Architecture Decision (UUID for Asterisk - initial plan):** Decided to generate a `uuid.uuid4()` in `CallAttemptHandler`, store it in `calls.call_uuid`, and use this in the WebSocket URI path.
- **Code Modifications (based on WebSocket assumption):** Updated `schema.sql`, `models.py`, `db_manager.py`, `call_attempt_handler.py`, `audio_socket_server.py`, `audio_socket_handler.py` to handle string UUIDs for the WebSocket path and map them to internal integer `call_id`.

v12.0:
- **Major Success (Call Origination & Dialplan - initial):** Achieved call origination where the phone rang and could be answered, using a `Local` channel and `Wait()` application.
- **AMI Event Reception Verified:** Confirmed Python received AMI events.
- **Issue Narrowed (at the time):** `app_audiosocket.c: Failed to parse UUID` became the main blocker (still assuming WebSocket `AudioSocket(URI,cn)`).

(Older versions summarized for brevity in previous Wayforward versions)

### 2.3. Core Architecture & Key Decisions

- **AudioSocket Protocol (Decision from v14.0):** The system will now use Asterisk's **raw TCP AudioSocket protocol** as defined by `AudioSocket(uuid, host:port)`. The Python server (`AudioSocketServer` and `AudioSocketHandler`) acts as a raw TCP server, expecting the specific binary framing protocol (initial `TYPE_UUID` frame, then audio/DTMF/hangup frames). This supersedes all previous WebSocket-based AudioSocket assumptions.

- **UUID Handling for TCP AudioSocket (Decision from v14.0):**
    1. `CallAttemptHandler` generates a string `asterisk_call_specific_uuid` (e.g., `uuid.uuid4()`).
    2. This UUID is stored in the `calls.call_uuid` column in the database.
    3. This UUID is passed to the Asterisk dialplan via `OPENDDEEP_VARS`.
    4. The dialplan uses this UUID as the *first argument* to `AudioSocket(${ASTERISK_CALL_UUID}, <IP>:<PORT>)`.
    5. Asterisk, upon TCP connection, sends a binary frame of `TYPE_UUID` containing this `ASTERISK_CALL_UUID` as its payload to the Python TCP server.
    6. The Python `AudioSocketHandler` reads this first frame, extracts the `asterisk_call_uuid`, and uses it to look up the internal integer `call_id` from the database.

- **Python Server for Audio (Decision from v14.0):** `audio_processing_service/audio_socket_server.py` is a simple `asyncio` raw TCP server. `audio_processing_service/audio_socket_handler.py` manages the state and frame processing for a single TCP connection from Asterisk, adhering to the binary AudioSocket protocol.

- **AMI Variable Passing (Decision from v11.0, still relevant):** Use a single pipe-separated string for `OPENDDEEP_VARS` passed via AMI `Originate`, parsed in the dialplan using `CUT()`. Current format: `ASTERISK_CALL_UUID|ACTUAL_TARGET_TO_DIAL`.

- **Local Channel for Call Structure (Decision from v11.0, still relevant):**
    - Python originates to `Local/s@opendeep-ai-leg`.
    - The `Originate` action's `Context` parameter directs the second leg to `[opendeep-human-leg]`.
    - `[opendeep-ai-leg]` handles `Answer()` and `AudioSocket()`.
    - `[opendeep-human-leg]` handles `Dial()` to the target.

(Other core decisions regarding AMI client, multi-tenancy, service separation remain as in previous versions unless directly superseded by the AudioSocket type change).

### 3.2. Detailed File Structure & Status

**config/app_config.py** [Modified] - Added `AUDIOSOCKET_READ_TIMEOUT_S`.
**database/db_manager.py** [Modified] - `get_call_by_asterisk_uuid` added. Ensured `**dict(row)` for Pydantic model instantiation.
**call_processor_service/call_attempt_handler.py** [Modified] - `Originate` params updated for `Local/s@opendeep-ai-leg` and `Context: opendeep-human-leg`. Unused variables in `_originate_call` removed. `_process_ami_event` updated.
**extensions.conf (Asterisk)** [Modified] - Contexts `[opendeep-ai-leg]` and `[opendeep-human-leg]` updated to use TCP `AudioSocket(${UUID},${HOST}:${PORT})` syntax.
**audio_processing_service/audio_socket_server.py** [Heavily Modified] - Changed from WebSocket server to raw TCP server. `_handle_new_connection` simplified, passes raw `reader`/`writer` to handler.
**audio_processing_service/audio_socket_handler.py** [Heavily Modified] - Rewritten for raw TCP AudioSocket protocol. `__init__` simplified. `handle_frames` now reads initial `TYPE_UUID` frame, looks up `call_id` by this UUID, then enters main frame loop. Sends an empty audio frame back after initial UUID processing.

## 4. IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (ACTION PLAN)

The immediate focus is to resolve Asterisk's "no activity on AudioSocket connection" timeout, which prevents the call from fully establishing and the phone from ringing properly. The empty audio frame sent by Python was not sufficient.

**Hypothesis:** Asterisk's TCP `AudioSocket` application, after sending its initial `TYPE_UUID` frame, either:
    a) Expects a continuous stream of audio frames (even silence) from the server to keep the socket "active."
    b) Or, it needs to have audio *from the Asterisk channel itself* (e.g., from the `Dial()` leg) to send to the Python server quickly, and if there's none, it times out.

**Next Test: Simplify Dialplan to Force Audio from Asterisk to Python via AudioSocket**

To isolate whether the issue is Python's responsibility to send keep-alives or Asterisk's responsibility to send initial channel audio:

1.  **Temporary Dialplan Change (`extensions.conf`):**
    *   Modify `CallAttemptHandler`'s `_originate_call` to use a new temporary context that *immediately plays audio on the channel before connecting AudioSocket*.
    *   **New Temporary Context `[test-audiosocket-playback-first]`:**
        ```ini
        [test-audiosocket-playback-first]
        exten => s,1,NoOp(==== Test AudioSocket with Early Playback ====)
            same => n,Set(ASTERISK_CALL_UUID=${CUT(OPENDDEEP_VARS,|,1)})
            same => n,Answer()
            ; Play a known, short sound file directly on this channel leg
            ; This ensures there is audio data available on the channel
            ; when AudioSocket starts.
            same => n,Playback(tt-monkeys) ; Or any short sound file like demo-congrats
            same => n,NoOp(Playback finished. Attempting AudioSocket with UUID: ${ASTERISK_CALL_UUID})
            same => n,AudioSocket(${ASTERISK_CALL_UUID},192.168.1.183:1200)
            same => n,NoOp(AudioSocket Status: ${AUDIOSOCKETSTATUS})
            same => n,Wait(5) ; Keep channel alive for a bit to see if audio frames flow
            same => n,Hangup()
        ```
    *   **Temporary Change in `call_processor_service/call_attempt_handler.py` (`_originate_call` method):**
        ```python
        # Inside _originate_call, TEMPORARILY change these for the test:
        originate_action = AmiAction(
            "Originate",
            Channel=f"Local/s@test-audiosocket-playback-first", # Target the new test context
            Context="default", # Second leg of Local channel is not the focus for this specific test
            Exten="s",
            Priority=1,
            # ... (CallerID, Timeout, Async as before) ...
            Variable=f"OPENDDEEP_VARS={self.asterisk_call_specific_uuid}|IGNORED_FOR_THIS_TEST" # Only UUID is used by test context
        )
        ```

2.  **Python `AudioSocketHandler` (`handle_frames`):**
    *   Temporarily **comment out** the section that sends the "initial empty AUDIO frame" *from Python to Asterisk*. We want to see if Asterisk will send audio *first* now that we're forcing playback on its channel.
        ```python
            # ...
            # --- NEW: Send an initial empty audio frame to Asterisk to acknowledge / keep-alive ---
            # COMMENT OUT THIS BLOCK FOR THE TEST
            # try:
            #     logger.info(f"[AudioSocketHandler-TCP:AppCallID={self.call_id},AstDialplanUUID={self.asterisk_call_uuid}] Sending initial empty AUDIO frame to Asterisk.")
            #     empty_audio_frame_header = struct.pack("!BH", TYPE_AUDIO, 0)
            #     if self.writer and not self.writer.is_closing():
            #         self.writer.write(empty_audio_frame_header)
            #         await self.writer.drain()
            #         logger.info(f"[AudioSocketHandler-TCP:AppCallID={self.call_id},AstDialplanUUID={self.asterisk_call_uuid}] Successfully sent initial empty AUDIO frame.")
            #     else: # ...
            # except Exception as e_send_empty: # ...
            # --- END COMMENT OUT ---

            # --- Main frame processing loop ---
            # ...
        ```

3.  **Execution & Observation:**
    *   `dialplan reload` in Asterisk.
    *   Restart Python application.
    *   Trigger a call from the UI.
    *   **Expected Outcome / Things to Check:**
        *   **Asterisk Logs:**
            *   Does the `Playback(tt-monkeys)` execute?
            *   Does the `AudioSocket(...)` line execute?
            *   Does the "Reached timeout after 2000 ms of no activity" error *still* appear?
        *   **Python Logs:**
            *   Does `AudioSocketHandler` still successfully receive the initial `TYPE_UUID` and map the `call_id`?
            *   **Most importantly:** After the UUID processing, does it start receiving `TYPE_AUDIO` frames from Asterisk (due to the `Playback` application)? Look for `"[AudioSocketHandler-TCP:...] Received AUDIO frame, len=..."` logs.
        *   **Phone Call:** The phone will likely *not* ring in this test because we are not using the `opendeep-human-leg` to `Dial()`. The focus is purely on stabilizing the `AudioSocket` connection on the AI leg.

**Interpreting Results of This Test:**

*   **If Python *receives audio frames* and Asterisk *does not time out*:** This strongly suggests the "no activity" timeout was because the `Local` channel's AI leg (`opendeep-ai-leg`) had no audio to send to the `AudioSocket` application initially. The solution would then involve ensuring that audio from the `Dial()` on the `opendeep-human-leg` is properly bridged or made available to the `opendeep-ai-leg` *before or as* `AudioSocket` connects. This could involve using `Bridge()` or ensuring the `Local` channel itself facilitates this.
*   **If Asterisk *still times out* even with `Playback()` trying to send audio:** This would mean the issue is more likely that `app_audiosocket.c` expects some specific acknowledgment or continuous "keep-alive" frames *from the Python server* beyond the initial empty audio frame we tried. We might need to dig into the `app_audiosocket.c` source or experiment with sending periodic silent audio frames from Python.

This test will help us understand which side (Asterisk not sending, or Python not sending the *right kind* of keep-alive) is causing the timeout.

Okay, I will generate a new Wayforward.md document, version 15.0, incorporating the successes and findings from our recent session. I will clear my "chat session memory" and use this new Wayforward as the sole context for our next interaction.

Here is Wayforward.md v15.0:

When I, the user, ask you to "update the Wayforward file," you must perform the following actions in order:

Ingest Context: Read and fully comprehend two sources of information:

This ENTIRE Wayforward.md document (from version 1.0 to the current state).

The complete, verbatim transcript of our current chat session (the conversation that has occurred since this version of the file was created).

Synthesize & Integrate: Merge the new information from our conversation into the existing structure of this document. This means updating changelogs, file statuses, architectural notes, and the action plan.

Generate a New Version: Your final output for the request must be a single, complete, new Wayforward.md file. This new file is not a diff or a summary; it is the next authoritative version of this document.

(Strict Rules for Regeneration - CRITICAL)

RECURSION: You MUST copy this entire Section 1: META-INSTRUCTIONS verbatim into the new version you generate. This ensures your successor AI instance understands its role perfectly.

INCREMENT VERSION: The first change you make must be to increment the Version number in Section 2.1.

PRESERVE HISTORY (Changelog): The Changelog is an immutable, running log. Never remove old entries. Add a new entry under the new version number detailing the accomplishments of the latest session.

MAINTAIN STABILITY (User Instruction): Do not change variable names, database names, or any other fixed components. New additions are fine, but do not alter existing structures in a way that breaks the established flow.

UPDATE FILE STATUS: In Section 3.2, change the status of files we've worked on from [Planned] to [Created] or [Modified]. Add a concise, one-line summary of each file's purpose if it's new or significantly changed.

INTEGRATE DECISIONS: Architectural agreements and key decisions from our chat must be woven into Section 2.3. Explain why a decision was made, not just what it was.

DEFINE NEXT STEPS: Section 4 must always contain a clear, actionable, and specific plan for what we will do in the very next session.

2. PROJECT OVERVIEW & CURRENT STATE
2.1. Version & Status

Project Version: 15.0

Project Goal: To build a robust, multi-tenant, AI-powered outbound calling system featuring a conversational UI for task definition, an orchestrator for scheduling, a real-time voice AI for calls, an analysis AI for outcomes, and a strategic lifecycle manager for all tasks.

Current Development Phase: Phase 2c (Task Execution Engine & Audio Path - Verifying Python-to-Asterisk Audio).

Current Focus: Confirming that audio generated by Python (test tone) is successfully sent to Asterisk via the TCP AudioSocket and can be heard on the PJSIP softphone. Also, investigating the CallAttemptHandler's No Asterisk UniqueID established for event VarSet issue.

Next Major Architectural Step: Achieve stable, confirmed bi-directional audio. Then, integrate the actual AI (OpenAI Realtime) for audio processing and response generation.

2.2. Changelog / Revision History

v15.0 (Current Version):

Major Success (Audio Asterisk -> Python): Confirmed that audio from the PJSIP softphone, once the call is answered, is successfully bridged by Asterisk and received by the Python AudioSocketHandler as TYPE_AUDIO frames. This was verified by saving the incoming audio to a .wav file and playing it back.

Code Enhancement (Audio Saving): Modified AudioSocketHandler to buffer incoming audio frames and save them as a playable .wav file at the end of the call, aiding diagnostics.

Code Enhancement (Test Tone Sending): Added code to AudioSocketHandler to generate and attempt to send a test tone (440Hz sine wave) from Python to Asterisk after the initial UUID exchange. Minimized initial sleep before tone sending for quicker testing.

Issue Identified (Tone Not Heard): While Python logs indicated an attempt to send the tone, the tone was not heard on the PJSIP softphone in the tests conducted so far. Python logs for the specific calls did not show the "PYTHON IS ABOUT TO SEND TEST TONE NOW" or "Sent test TONE frame..." messages, suggesting the tone sending block was not reached or completed, likely due to premature call termination.

Issue Observed (CallAttemptHandler): Logs from CallAttemptHandler like [CallAttemptHandler:12] No Asterisk UniqueID established for event VarSet. Ignoring. indicate a potential de-synchronization or misconfiguration in how CallAttemptHandler correlates AMI events to identify its primary Asterisk channel UniqueID. This is a secondary issue to the audio path but needs to be addressed for robust call state management.

Asterisk Behavior Clarified (AUDIOSOCKETSTATUS): Realized that an empty ${AUDIOSOCKETSTATUS} after AudioSocket() returns might be expected if the AudioSocket terminates due to its underlying Asterisk channel being hung up (e.g., by the other leg of a Local channel), rather than an explicit failure of the AudioSocket TCP connection itself. The primary indicator of AudioSocket() starting correctly is the successful UUID exchange with Python and subsequent audio flow.

Asterisk Behavior Clarified (app_audiosocket.c warning): The warning app_audiosocket.c:183 audiosocket_run: Failed to receive frame from channel... is understood to be a consequence of the Asterisk channel (that AudioSocket is attached to) being torn down, usually initiated by the hangup of the connected PJSIP phone.

v14.0:

Critical Realization (AudioSocket Type): Confirmed Asterisk uses raw TCP AudioSocket(uuid,host:port).

Architecture Pivot (Python Server): AudioSocketServer changed to raw TCP; AudioSocketHandler modified for TCP protocol, initial UUID frame read, and DB lookup.

Dialplan Correction: Updated to correct AudioSocket() syntax.

Bug Fixes: Resolved NameError and AttributeError in Python code.

Progress: Python AudioSocketHandler successfully receives and parses UUID, looks up call_id.

New Issue Identified (at the time): Asterisk "no activity on AudioSocket connection" timeout after initial UUID exchange. Python's connection dropped during subsequent reads.

v13.0:

Root Cause Diagnosis (UUID - initial, based on WebSocket assumption): Believed app_audiosocket.c "Failed to parse UUID" was due to non-standard UUID in WebSocket URI path.

Architecture Decision (UUID for Asterisk - initial plan): Generate uuid.uuid4() in CallAttemptHandler, store in calls.call_uuid, use in WebSocket URI.

Code Modifications (based on WebSocket assumption): Updated various components for string UUIDs in WebSocket path.

(Older versions summarized for brevity in previous Wayforward versions)

2.3. Core Architecture & Key Decisions

AudioSocket Protocol (Decision from v14.0, Confirmed): System uses Asterisk's raw TCP AudioSocket protocol. Python acts as the TCP server.

UUID Handling for TCP AudioSocket (Decision from v14.0, Confirmed & Working for Asterisk->Python UUID transfer): CallAttemptHandler generates UUID -> stored in DB -> passed to dialplan -> Asterisk sends as first frame -> Python AudioSocketHandler reads and maps to call_id.

Audio Flow (Current Understanding):

Asterisk to Python: Confirmed working. Audio from an answered PJSIP call is received by Python's AudioSocketHandler.

Python to Asterisk: Attempting to send a test tone. Not yet confirmed heard on PJSIP phone. This is the current primary focus.

Local Channel for Call Structure (Decision from v11.0, Current Dialplan):

Python AMI originates to Local/s@opendeep-ai-leg.

Originate action's Context directs second leg to [opendeep-human-leg].

[opendeep-ai-leg] handles Answer() and AudioSocket().

[opendeep-human-leg] handles Dial() to the target PJSIP phone.

Call Termination: Currently initiated by manual hangup of the PJSIP phone. This causes the Local channel to tear down, which in turn closes the TCP connection to AudioSocketHandler. The Python handler detects this as a connection error/EOF. AMI Hangup events will also be important for state tracking.

(Other core decisions regarding AMI client, multi-tenancy, service separation remain as in previous versions).

4. IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (ACTION PLAN)

Primary Goal: Achieve and Confirm Bidirectional Audio via TCP AudioSocket.
(Audio Asterisk -> Python is confirmed. Need to confirm Python -> Asterisk.)

Verify Python Tone Sending & Reception on PJSIP Phone:

Action: In audio_processing_service/audio_socket_handler.py (handle_frames method):

Ensure the "TEST: Python sends audio to Asterisk" block (with numpy for tone generation) is active.

Ensure the await asyncio.sleep(0.1) (or similar very short/no delay) is set before the logger.critical("PYTHON IS ABOUT TO SEND TEST TONE NOW...").

Ensure the code to save incoming audio to a .wav file is active.

Test Procedure:

Restart Python application and reload Asterisk dialplan (using the standard opendeep-ai-leg and opendeep-human-leg, not the Playback() test dialplan).

Initiate a call from the UI.

Answer the call on the PJSIP/7000 softphone.

Listen very carefully on the PJSIP phone for the 1-second test tone shortly after the call connects.

Speak into the PJSIP phone for several seconds.

Keep the call active for at least 10-15 seconds total to allow all test sequences to run.

Hang up the call from the PJSIP/7000 softphone.

Check:

Python Logs:

Confirm the CRITICAL: PYTHON IS ABOUT TO SEND TEST TONE NOW... log appears.

Confirm the DEBUG: Sent test TONE frame X/50 to Asterisk. logs appear for multiple frames.

Confirm INFO: TEST: Finished sending test TONE. appears.

Confirm DEBUG: Received AUDIO frame, len=320 logs appear (for audio from PJSIP phone).

PJSIP Phone: Was the tone audible?

Saved WAV file: Check temp_recordings_from_asterisk_wav/incoming_audio_YOUR_UUID.wav. Does it contain your speech? Is the initial "toooomp" still there or different?

If Tone is NOT Heard (but Python logs show it attempted to send):

Analyze Asterisk Logs: Look for any warnings or errors in Asterisk CLI that coincide with the timestamps when Python was trying to send the tone. Does Asterisk acknowledge receiving these TCP packets from Python? Does it try to play them? (e.g., AudioSocket debug if available).

Verify PCM Format: Double-check that the tone_payload_chunk is indeed 320 bytes of 8kHz, 16-bit, mono, little-endian PCM. Asterisk can be picky.

Consider AUDIOSOCKETSTATUS again (briefly): If the tone is sent by Python but not heard, and Asterisk's AudioSocket() still returns with an empty status before the manual hangup, this might indicate Asterisk isn't happy with the audio frames it's receiving from Python for some reason.

If Tone IS Heard:

MAJOR SUCCESS! This confirms basic bidirectional audio.

Next Immediate Step: Remove the test tone sending block. Implement the OpenAIRealtimeClient (can be a new file like audio_processing_service/openai_realtime_client.py).

In AudioSocketHandler:

When audio is received from Asterisk, forward it to OpenAIRealtimeClient.

When OpenAIRealtimeClient produces audio output, frame it (TYPE_AUDIO, length, PCM payload) and send it to Asterisk via the writer.

Secondary Issue: CallAttemptHandler and VarSet Events:

Once bidirectional audio is confirmed, revisit call_processor_service/call_attempt_handler.py and its _process_ami_event method.

Analyze why self.asterisk_unique_id might not be set when VarSet events arrive. This might involve ensuring the ActionID from the Originate action is correctly associated with the UniqueID of the Local/...;2 channel (the AI leg) through early AMI events like Newchannel or OriginateResponse. The goal is for CallAttemptHandler to reliably know which Asterisk call it's managing based on UniqueID to process subsequent events like Hangup correctly for that specific call.

This plan prioritizes confirming the Python-to-Asterisk audio path.
