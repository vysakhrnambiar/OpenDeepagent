## 2. PROJECT OVERVIEW & CURRENT STATE

### 2.1. Version & Status

Project Version: 11.0

Project Goal: To build a robust, multi-tenant, AI-powered outbound calling system featuring a conversational UI for task definition, an orchestrator for scheduling, a real-time voice AI for calls, an analysis AI for outcomes, and a strategic lifecycle manager for all tasks, with capabilities for Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) feedback.

Current Development Phase:
- Phase 1 (UI Foundation): Complete.
- Phase 1.5 (Fixes & Search Tool): Complete.
- Phase 1.6 (Authoritative Business Search & API Integration): Complete.
- Phase 2a (LLM Campaign Orchestration - UI Button & Backend Service): Complete.
- Phase 2b (Task Execution Engine): OrchestratorService successfully creates campaigns and tasks. TaskSchedulerService initializes and polls. CallInitiatorService and CallAttemptHandler structures are in place. AMI client connects.

Current Focus: Debugging why `TaskSchedulerService` is not picking up newly created (and presumably due) tasks from the database, despite successful task creation by `OrchestratorService`.

Next Major Architectural Step: Achieving the first successful call origination via the integrated services chain, then integrating the AudioSocket service.

### 2.2. Changelog / Revision History

v11.0 (Current Version):
- **Success (Campaign & Task Creation):** Resolved `NameError` (typo `master_agent_promt`) and `ValidationError` (missing `user_id` in `TaskCreate`) in `OrchestratorService`. Campaigns and tasks are now successfully created in the database when triggered from the UI via `/api/execute_campaign`.
- **Success (Lifespan Manager):** Implemented FastAPI `lifespan` manager in `web_interface/app.py` (calling lifecycle functions from `main.py`), resolving the duplicate service initialization issue caused by Uvicorn's reloader. Services now start cleanly once.
- **Bug (Task Not Picked Up):** `TaskSchedulerService` is polling but consistently reports "No due tasks found" even after tasks are confirmed to be created in the `tasks` table with `status='pending'` and a recent `next_action_time`.
- **Debugging Focus:** Added detailed logging to `db_manager.get_due_tasks` to trace query execution, parameters, fetched rows, and Pydantic parsing.
- **Schema Fix (DND List):** Identified and corrected a missing `user_id` column in the `dnd_list` table schema (`database/schema.sql`) and instructed for DB re-initialization. This was a prior error source during `TaskSchedulerService` processing.
- **Async Call Pattern Refinement:** Clarified and applied `await` vs. `await loop.run_in_executor()` for `db_manager` functions based on their `def` vs `async def` signatures in `CallInitiatorService` and `CallAttemptHandler`. (Still verifying the exact state of `db_manager.py` for final confirmation).
- **AMI Client:** `AsteriskAmiClient` connects and logs in successfully. A brief ping failure was observed but the client attempted recovery.

v10.0:
- Major Success (AMI Client Refactor): Successfully refactored `AsteriskAmiClient` to use `asterisk-ami==0.1.7`, enabling reliable AMI connection, login, action sending, and event dispatch.
- Debugging: Resolved numerous errors during AMI client refactoring.
- File Updates: call_processor_service/asterisk_ami_client.py significantly refactored and verified as working standalone.
- Clarification: Confirmed the nature of asterisk-ami==0.1.7 and its API patterns.

v9.0:
- Architecture Decision (AMI Client): Decided to pursue Option 2 for AMI handling: a centralized py-asterisk client running in a dedicated OS thread, with an async wrapper for the rest of the application. This change will be implemented in a subsequent phase after attempting to resolve the current login issue with the custom AsteriskAmiClient or making one final focused debugging pass on it.
- Debugging Focus: Identified that the current AMI login failure with the custom AsteriskAmiClient is not due to Asterisk server-side configuration (manager.conf, users, permits) or credentials, as confirmed by a successful manual Telnet AMI login test using the same credentials and from the same application server IP. The issue lies within the Python AsteriskAmiClient's implementation or its interaction with asyncio streams during the login sequence.
- Clarification (WebSockets & Threads): Confirmed that WebSockets for audio (Asterisk AudioSocket to app, app to OpenAI Realtime Voice/TTS) will be handled by asyncio tasks within the main event loop, not dedicated OS threads per WebSocket. The only dedicated OS thread under consideration is for wrapping the synchronous py-asterisk library.
- File Updates:
  - database/models.py: Added app_config import to resolve NameError.
  - call_processor_service/asterisk_ami_client.py: Added datetime and uuid imports to resolve NameError in AmiAction.
  - main.py: Added typing.Optional import. Noted on_event deprecation for future refactoring to lifespan events.
- Test Mode: Confirmed implementation details for "Test Mode" (redirecting calls to a specific number, forcing sequential execution) involving app_config settings and logic in CallInitiatorService and CallAttemptHandler. Noted .env variables needed for this.

v8.0:
- Feature Started (Phase 2b): Created initial structure for task_manager/task_scheduler_svc.py.
- Meta-Instruction Added: Permanent rule for AI to avoid changing fixed component names.

v7.0:
- Architecture: Detailed TaskLifecycleManagerService. Solidified multi-tenancy. Refined call concurrency understanding. Clarified DND responsibility.
- Architecture: Detailed the "Meta-OODA" agent, now named TaskLifecycleManagerService. Confirmed it will be a dedicated, LLM-driven service responsible for strategic oversight of all tasks (short and long-running), dynamic determination of task nature, proactive user check-ins for long tasks, and ensuring no collisions with PostCallAnalyzerService.
- Architecture: Solidified the pervasive multi-tenancy design principle. All new services, database queries, and LLM interactions must be strictly scoped by user_id to ensure data isolation.
- Architecture: Refined the understanding of call concurrency. CallInitiatorService enforces MAX_CONCURRENT_CALLS by managing how many CallAttemptHandler tasks are active. Each live call will have an AudioSocketHandler (spawned by AudioSocketServer upon Asterisk connection) and a corresponding CallAttemptHandler (managing AMI commands via Redis).
- Architecture: Clarified that DND list checks are the responsibility of the TaskSchedulerService (pre-call) and PostCallAnalyzerService (post-call update). "OODA" does not refer to DND.
- Planning: Confirmed that task prioritization will be a future enhancement involving database schema changes and logic updates in the TaskSchedulerService and OrchestratorService.

v6.0:
- Feature Complete (Phase 2a): Successfully implemented the OrchestratorService and the /api/execute_campaign endpoint. The "Confirm and Schedule Campaign" button now creates campaign and task records.
- Fixes: Resolved multiple TypeErrors, AttributeErrors, and NameErrors across UIAssistantService, OpenAIFormClient, and OrchestratorService related to function arguments, method existence, and imports. Corrected logic in get_authoritative_business_info to use direct HTTP calls.
- Architecture: Initial detailed planning for Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) feedback. Clarified distinct roles of Orchestrator, Scheduler, and Post-Call Analyzer.

v5.0:
- Fix: Resolved persistent 403 Forbidden errors from Google Cloud APIs by consolidating to a single project.
- Upgrade: Migrated from legacy googlemaps library to modern Places API (New) via direct HTTP requests.
- Enhancement: Added "Feedback Loop" instruction to UI_ASSISTANT_SYSTEM_PROMPT.
- Enhancement: Implemented _is_plan_valid validation check in UIAssistantService.

v4.0:
- Feature: Implemented get_authoritative_business_info tool using Google Places API.
- Refactor: Updated UIAssistantService to support multiple tools.
- Dependency: Added googlemaps library (later replaced).

v3.0:
- Meta: Re-architected this Wayforward.md file to be a comprehensive, self-sustaining context document.

v2.0:
- Feature: Implemented generic search_internet tool for broader information queries.
- Refactor: Updated ui_assistant_svc.py with robust tool-calling loop.
- Refactor: Created information_retriever_svc.py and google_gemini_client.py.
- Fix: Resolved ModuleNotFoundError for google.generativeai with correct pip install.

v1.0:
- Fix: Corrected non-functional "Submit Answers" button in frontend form.
- Fix: Resolved username editing issue, allowing editing until first message is sent.
- Fix: Corrected CSS/HTML layout issues, restoring single-centered chat window.
- Feature: Built initial conversational UI with default username.
- Core: Established base project structure, database schema, and FastAPI application.

### 2.3. Core Architecture & Key Decisions

Stability Mandate: Do not change variable names, database names, or any other fixed components. New additions are fine, but do not alter existing structures in a way that breaks the established flow.

Lifespan Management (Decision from v11.0): FastAPI's `lifespan` context manager is now used for application startup and shutdown, providing a more robust way to manage background service initialization and termination compared to `on_event` decorators, especially with Uvicorn's reloader.

Database Schema (`tasks` and `dnd_list` tables - v11.0):
- `tasks` table schema confirmed to require `user_id`.
- `dnd_list` table schema updated to include `user_id` and a `UNIQUE(user_id, phone_number)` constraint to support per-user DND lists.

Async DB Calls (Ongoing Refinement - v11.0): The pattern for calling `db_manager.py` functions from `async` services is:
- If `db_manager.func()` is `def` (synchronous): use `await loop.run_in_executor(None, db_manager.func, ...)`
- If `db_manager.func()` is `async def` (asynchronous wrapper or true async): use `await db_manager.func(...)`
This is being applied consistently across services.

AMI Client Implementation (Decision from v10.0, superseding v9.0 plan):
- The system now uses a refactored AsteriskAmiClient that wraps the asterisk-ami==0.1.7 library.
- This client runs the synchronous asterisk-ami.AMIClient in a dedicated OS worker thread.
- It uses thread-safe queues for actions and asyncio.Future (internally, via the library's FutureResponse) for responses, bridged to the main asyncio loop.
- Events from the library are passed via call_soon_threadsafe to an async dispatcher.
- This approach leverages a working, albeit simpler, external AMI library and avoids the complexities of a fully custom asyncio AMI protocol implementation for now.

Audio WebSockets (Decision from v9.0):
- Incoming audio connections from Asterisk (via AudioSocket) and outgoing connections to OpenAI Realtime Voice (and any other TTS services) will be handled by native asyncio libraries (e.g., websockets).
- Each live call's audio stream will be managed by an asyncio task (e.g., an AudioSocketHandler instance) without requiring a dedicated OS thread per WebSocket.

Multi-Tenancy: Foundational principle. Data isolation via user_id in DB tables and service logic. LLM context scoped by user_id. User-specific DND lists.

Separation of Concerns & Control Flow for Calls:
- TaskSchedulerService (asyncio task): Polls DB, DND checks, hands to CallInitiatorService.
- CallInitiatorService (asyncio methods, called by Scheduler): Manages MAX_CONCURRENT_CALLS, creates calls DB record, spawns/starts CallAttemptHandler.
- CallAttemptHandler (asyncio task, one per call attempt):
  - Manages AMI interaction for one call via the chosen AMI client strategy.
  - Instructs Asterisk to connect audio to AudioSocketServer.
  - Listens for commands from AudioSocketHandler via Redis.
  - Updates calls DB. Notifies CallInitiatorService on completion.
- AudioSocketServer (asyncio task): Listens for AudioSocket connections from Asterisk.
- AudioSocketHandler (asyncio task, one per live audio stream): Bridges audio between Asterisk and OpenAI. Publishes control commands to Redis.
- PostCallAnalyzerService & TaskLifecycleManagerService: As previously defined.

Separation of Concerns (Orchestrator, Scheduler, Analyzer):
- Orchestrator (OrchestratorService): A one-time setup agent that takes the UI's final campaign_plan and creates database records. Once complete, its job is done for that plan.
- Scheduler (TaskSchedulerService): A persistent, long-running background process that polls for due tasks and initiates call attempts.
- Post-Call Analyzer (AnalysisService): A decision-making agent that analyzes call outcomes and determines next steps.

Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Feedback:
- Allows the Live Call AI to request immediate feedback from the UI user during active calls.
- Involves a request_user_feedback tool, WebSocket bridge, feedback_requests table, and enhancements to call handling components.

TaskLifecycleManagerService (Meta-OODA Agent): Proactive & Strategic. LLM-driven.
- Oversees all tasks for all users (respecting user_id scoping).
- Monitors task queues, progress of long-running tasks, identifies stuck tasks.
- Dynamically determines task nature (long/short running).
- Decides on strategic adjustments (dynamic prioritization, prompt revisions, placing tasks on hold).
- Manages inter-call context for long-lived/phased tasks.
- Initiates proactive user check-ins for long-running tasks via UI.
- Acts by updating DB records, influencing the TaskSchedulerService.

Tool-Augmented AI:
- UIAssistantService uses a two-step tool-calling loop for factual queries.
- Specialized tools include get_authoritative_business_info for business data and search_internet for general information.

Modern API Usage:
- Deliberate use of Google Places API (New) via direct HTTP requests for reliability and future-proofing.

Task vs. Call Distinction:
- A Task is the overall objective defined by the user (e.g., "book a dentist appointment").
- A Call is an individual attempt to complete a Task. A single Task may involve multiple Call attempts.
- SQLite schema reflects this with tasks and calls tables.

Development & Testing Strategies:
- Test Mode:
  - Activated by APP_TEST_MODE=True in .env.
  - All outbound calls redirected to APP_TEST_MODE_REDIRECT_NUMBER (e.g., "7000").
  - MAX_CONCURRENT_CALLS forced to 1 by CallInitiatorService.
  - Implemented by logic in CallInitiatorService (concurrency) and CallAttemptHandler (number redirection during Originate).
- Iterative Testing: Aim for basic operational testing of components as they are integrated, before moving too many steps ahead, to catch issues early.

Resilience and Error Handling:
- Handles unexpected call drops by logging errors and setting tasks for analysis.
- Implements retry logic with backoff for transient issues.
- Gracefully handles service failures across DB, Redis, and OpenAI dependencies.

Future Improvements Noted:
- Refactor FastAPI on_event("startup") and on_event("shutdown") to use modern "lifespan" events.
- Transition database/db_manager.py to use a fully asynchronous database library (e.g., aiosqlite) for improved performance under high concurrency.
- Implement global DND based on a threshold of user-specific DNDs.
- Implement richer user profiles to enhance AI contextual awareness.

## 4. IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (ACTION PLAN)

The immediate priority is to diagnose why `TaskSchedulerService` is not finding the newly created tasks, even though `OrchestratorService` confirms their creation in the database.

1. **Verify Database State After Task Creation:**
   * After the UI flow creates a campaign and `/api/execute_campaign` returns a success (200 OK), manually inspect the `tasks` table in `test_opendeep.db` (or your DB file).
   * **Query:** `SELECT id, campaign_id, user_id, status, next_action_time, typeof(next_action_time), current_attempt_count, max_attempts FROM tasks WHERE campaign_id = <the_new_campaign_id>;`
   * **Confirm:**
     * A task record exists for the new campaign.
     * `status` is 'pending'.
     * `next_action_time` is a valid recent timestamp string (e.g., "2025-06-11 HH:MM:SS.ffffff").
     * `typeof(next_action_time)` is 'text'.
     * `current_attempt_count` is 0.
     * `max_attempts` is your default (e.g., 3).
     * `user_id` is correct.

2. **Analyze Detailed Logs from `db_manager.get_due_tasks`:**
   * Ensure the detailed logging (query, params, fetched rows count, parsing success/errors) added previously to `db_manager.get_due_tasks` is active.
   * After creating a task via the UI, observe the application logs during the next poll cycle of `TaskSchedulerService`.
   * **Focus on these log lines from `get_due_tasks`:**
     * `DEBUG - db_manager.py: ... - get_due_tasks: Executing query: ... with params: ...` (Verify the query and that 'pending' is in the status params).
     * `DEBUG - db_manager.py: ... - get_due_tasks: Fetched X raw rows from DB.` (If X is 0, the SQL query itself is the primary issue. If X is 1 (or more), the issue is in subsequent Python processing within `get_due_tasks`).
     * If rows are fetched, any Pydantic parsing logs (`Successfully parsed task ID...` or `Error parsing row...`).

3. **Review `db_manager.get_due_tasks` SQL Query Conditions:**
   Based on the logs from step 2, re-evaluate each part of the `WHERE` clause against the confirmed data in the `tasks` table (from step 1).
   * `status IN ('pending', 'retry_scheduled', 'on_hold')` (or similar)
   * `(next_action_time IS NULL OR next_action_time <= CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)`
   * `current_attempt_count < max_attempts`

4. **If SQL returns 0 rows (but task exists and *should* match):**
   * Consider subtle issues with SQLite's `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` vs. the stored text timestamp. Temporarily simplify the `next_action_time` condition in `get_due_tasks` to just `(next_action_time IS NOT NULL)` or even remove it entirely for one test run to see if tasks are then picked up (this would isolate the time comparison as the problem).
   * Ensure `datetime` objects are being stored in a consistent ISO8601 format that SQLite's date/time functions can compare correctly with `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` if direct string comparison isn't working as expected. SQLite usually handles standard ISO8601 strings well.

Once `TaskSchedulerService` successfully picks up a task:
* The logs should show it being passed to `CallInitiatorService`.
* `CallInitiatorService` should spawn `CallAttemptHandler`.
* `CallAttemptHandler` should use `AsteriskAmiClient` to send an `Originate` action.
* Asterisk CLI should show the call attempt, and your test extension should ring.

This systematic debugging of `get_due_tasks` is the critical path to unblocking call origination.


Of course. This is a huge milestone. The phone ringing means the entire chain of command from Python -> AMI -> Asterisk Dialplan -> PJSIP is working perfectly. We have successfully solved the origination and variable-passing problem.

The two new issues ("no sound" and "websocket server stopped") are the expected next layer of problems, and they are much easier to solve now that the call is connecting.

Here is the updated Wayforward document. It captures our success, identifies the new issues, and sets a clear plan for our next session.

2. PROJECT OVERVIEW & CURRENT STATE
2.1. Version & Status

Project Version: 12.0

Project Goal: To build a robust, multi-tenant, AI-powered outbound calling system featuring a conversational UI for task definition, an orchestrator for scheduling, a real-time voice AI for calls, an analysis AI for outcomes, and a strategic lifecycle manager for all tasks.

Current Development Phase: Phase 2b (Task Execution Engine).

Current Focus: Debugging the AudioSocketServer crash on connection and resolving the one-way/no-way audio (RTP) issue.

Next Major Architectural Step: Stabilize the full audio path from the PJSIP phone through Asterisk to the Python WebSocket server, then integrate real-time AI processing.

2.2. Changelog / Revision History

v12.0 (Current Version):

Major Success (Call Origination): Successfully resolved all issues preventing call origination. The full command and control pipeline from the Python application to the target PJSIP phone is now functional.

Debugging Journey & Fixes:

Corrected Originate command to use Local channels to properly execute dialplan logic.

Solved AMI variable passing by using a single pipe-separated (|) string and parsing it in the dialplan with CUT(), after determining the asterisk-ami library mishandled list-based variables.

Resolved the Local channel premature hangup issue by changing the Originate Application from NoOp to Wait(3600), ensuring the channel stays alive for the duration of the call.

Fixed PJSIP CONGESTION status by correctly linking the endpoint to its aors in pjsip.conf.

Fixed PJSIP NOANSWER status by enabling qualify_frequency on the AOR to ensure the endpoint was Avail.

Fixed the final PJSIP CONGESTION status by diagnosing and correcting the UDP/TCP transport mismatch between the endpoint configuration and the phone's registration.

New Issues Identified:

The Python AudioSocketServer process crashes or stops when Asterisk attempts to connect to it.

The answered call has no audio ("dead air").

v11.0:

Success (Task Creation): Resolved NameError and ValidationError in OrchestratorService, enabling successful task creation from the UI.

Success (Lifespan): Implemented FastAPI lifespan manager, fixing duplicate service initialization.

Bug Identified: TaskSchedulerService was not picking up due tasks.

v10.0:

Major Success (AMI Client): Successfully refactored AsteriskAmiClient to use the asterisk-ami library, enabling reliable AMI connection and login.

(Older versions summarized for brevity)

2.3. Core Architecture & Key Decisions

AMI Variable Passing Strategy (Decision from v11.0): Initial attempts to pass variables as a list using _ and __ prefixes failed due to suspected issues in the asterisk-ami library's handling of the Variable key. The only successful and robust method found was to combine all necessary variables into a single pipe-separated (|) string, pass it as a single AMI variable (e.g., _OPENDDEEP_VARS), and parse this string within the Asterisk dialplan using the CUT() function. This minimizes the risk of library misinterpretation.

Local Channel Origination (Decision from v11.0): To execute dialplan logic (like AudioSocket) on an originated call, the Local channel is used. The Originate Application is set to Wait with a long timeout (e.g., 3600) to keep the primary channel leg alive while the secondary leg executes the main dialplan logic, including Dial and other applications.

(Other core decisions remain as in previous versions)

3. IMPLEMENTATION & FILE MANIFEST
3.1. Required Libraries

fastapi, uvicorn, sqlalchemy, redis, openai, python-dotenv, pydantic, google-generativeai, httpx, asterisk-ami==0.1.7.

3.2. Detailed File Structure & Status

call_processor_service/call_attempt_handler.py [Heavily Modified] - Contains the now working Originate logic using the Local channel and pipe-separated variables.

pjsip.conf / Asterisk Dialplan [Heavily Modified] - Dialplan now correctly parses variables from AMI and contains the full logic to Dial and then run AudioSocket. PJSIP endpoint configured for NAT and correct transport.

audio_processing_service/audio_socket_server.py [Created] - The WebSocket server that listens for connections from Asterisk. This is the next primary debugging target.

audio_processing_service/audio_socket_handler.py [Created] - The handler for individual WebSocket connections. Also a primary debugging target.

(Other files have not been changed in this session).

4. IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (ACTION PLAN)

Our next session will focus on two parallel streams to solve the two new problems. The top priority is to stabilize the WebSocket server.

Priority 1: Debug the AudioSocketServer Crash

The server stopping indicates an unhandled exception. We need to find it.

Add Robust Exception Logging: We will add comprehensive try...except blocks around the key operational areas of the audio_processing_service to catch and log any and all exceptions.

In audio_socket_server.py: Wrap the entire body of the _handle_new_connection method in a try...except Exception as e: block. Log the exception with full traceback (exc_info=True).

In audio_socket_handler.py: Wrap the entire body of the handle_frames method in a try...except Exception as e: block and log with traceback.

Verify Handshake Logic: The crash likely happens during the initial WebSocket upgrade handshake. We will add verbose logging to _handle_new_connection to trace its progress:

Log upon receiving a new connection.

Log the raw HTTP request line it reads from the StreamReader.

Log the parsed call_id.

Log right before it sends the 101 Switching Protocols response.

Log right after it successfully creates the AudioSocketHandler instance.

Goal: To see the exact error and traceback that causes the server/handler to crash. This will tell us if it's an issue with parsing, IO, or something else.

Priority 2: Diagnose the "No Audio" (RTP) Issue

This is an Asterisk-level problem, likely related to media (RTP) flow with the Local channel.

Enable RTP Debugging: In the Asterisk CLI, before placing the call, we will run rtp set debug on.

Place the Call and Answer: Trigger the call from Python and answer it on your Linphone.

Analyze RTP Logs: The Asterisk CLI will now show RTP packet information.

We need to see if RTP packets are flowing from your phone (192.168.1.59) to Asterisk (192.168.1.24) when you speak.

We need to see if Asterisk is trying to send RTP packets (even if they are silent packets from the AudioSocket app) to your phone.

Check NAT & directmedia: We have direct_media=no on the endpoint, which is correct. This forces audio through Asterisk. The rtp set debug on will confirm if Asterisk is correctly handling the media paths between the PJSIP/7000 channel and the Local channel where the AudioSocket application is running. It's possible the audio bridge between the two legs of the Local channel is not being established correctly.

By tackling these two issues simultaneously, we can stabilize the entire call path and have a working end-to-end connection with a live audio stream ready for AI integration.
