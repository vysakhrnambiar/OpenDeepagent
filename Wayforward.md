Understood. This is a perfect time to consolidate our progress and the plan forward. I will create a comprehensive "Project State and Forward Plan" document. This will serve as your context when you restart our session.

Here's the consolidated information:

OpenDeep - Project State and Forward Plan (As of current discussion)

Overall Goal: To build an AI-powered outbound calling system that can schedule and manage tasks, make calls via Asterisk, interact with users using OpenAI's Realtime Audio API (for live calls) and Form LLM (for prompt generation/analysis), log transcripts, and handle outcomes including retries.

Core Technologies Chosen:

Web Framework: FastAPI (with Uvicorn)

Database: SQLite (for persistent storage of tasks, calls, transcripts, etc.)

Realtime Call AI: OpenAI Realtime Audio API (inspired by asty.py)

Task/Analysis AI: OpenAI Form LLM (GPT-4o or similar, via standard Chat Completions API)

Telephony: Asterisk (interaction via AMI, inspired by outboundas.py)

Inter-Process Communication (IPC) for live call commands: Redis Pub/Sub

Programming Language: Python (with asyncio for I/O bound services)

Key Architectural Decisions & Nuances Discussed:

Task vs. Call Distinction:

A Task is the overall objective defined by the user (e.g., "book a dentist appointment").

A Call is an individual attempt to complete a Task. A single Task may involve multiple Call attempts.

SQLite schema reflects this with tasks and calls tables.

LLM-Assisted Task Creation (Mandatory & Iterative):

The Web UI facilitates an iterative process where the user provides a task description.

The TaskCreationService uses an OpenAIFormClient (with AGENT_INSTRUCTION_GENERATOR_SYSTEM_PROMPT) to:

Analyze the user's input for completeness.

If information is missing, generate questions (prefixed with [QUESTIONS_FOR_USER]) to be displayed to the user via the UI.

Once sufficient information is gathered (through potentially multiple iterations with the user via the UI), generate a detailed agent prompt (prefixed with [AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS]) for the Realtime Call LLM.

This ensures well-defined instructions for the live call agent.

Database Roles:

SQLite: Primary persistent storage for tasks, calls (attempts), call_transcripts, call_events, dnd_list. Source of truth for scheduled actions and history.

Redis: Acts as a real-time Command Bus using Pub/Sub. Used by the AudioSocketHandler (representing the Realtime LLM) to send commands (e.g., send_dtmf, end_call) to the CallAttemptHandler that manages the live Asterisk channel for a specific call attempt.

Transcript Logging:

The AudioSocketHandler will log speaker turns (user and agent) from the OpenAI Realtime API to the call_transcripts table in SQLite, associated with the specific calls.id.

Post-Call Analysis & Automated Rescheduling:

After a call attempt concludes, its status is marked (e.g., completed_attempt).

The PostCallAnalyzerService polls for such calls.

It uses OpenAIFormClient (with POST_CALL_ANALYSIS_SYSTEM_PROMPT) to analyze the call transcript against the original task prompt.

The LLM returns a structured JSON indicating if the task is complete, if a retry is needed, when to retry, and a suggested prompt for the next attempt.

Based on this, the PostCallAnalyzerService updates the main tasks record (status, overall conclusion) and, if a retry is needed, sets tasks.next_action_time. The TaskSchedulerService will then pick this up to initiate a new call attempt.

Modularity: The project is structured into services/modules with single responsibilities (e.g., task_manager, call_processor_service, audio_processing_service, web_interface, llm_integrations, common, database).

Path Hack for Direct Execution: For running individual submodule scripts directly (e.g., python task_manager/task_creation_svc.py), a sys.path modification snippet is placed at the top of these scripts to allow them to find other project modules like config or common.

This document should provide a solid foundation for you to restart with, combining our discussions into a coherent plan for the remaining files. Remember to test each component and its interactions incrementally!

Under "Key Architectural Decisions & Nuances," add:
Resilience and Error Handling:
Unexpected Call Drops (Asterisk/AudioSocket): If an AudioSocket connection drops unexpectedly or Asterisk signals a hangup not initiated by the AI's end_call function, the CallAttemptHandler should detect this (e.g., through socket errors or specific AMI hangup events). It will then:
Log the error and the hangup cause in the calls table.
Set the calls.status to 'failed_attempt' (or a specific 'dropped_connection' status).
Crucially, it will still set tasks.status='pending_analysis' and tasks.next_action_time=now(). This ensures the PostCallAnalyzerService reviews the (potentially incomplete) transcript and task to decide if a retry is warranted, rather than the call attempt just vanishing.
Service Failures (Redis, OpenAI, DB): Each service (TaskScheduler, CallInitiator, AudioSocketHandler, PostCallAnalyzer) should have robust try-except blocks for its critical operations (e.g., connecting to Redis/DB, API calls).
For transient issues (e.g., temporary network blip to Redis/OpenAI), implement retry logic with backoff within the service.
For persistent failures, log detailed errors. The impact will depend on the service:
DB failure is critical and might halt most operations.
Redis failure will break live call command execution.
OpenAI API failure will prevent new prompt generation, analysis, and live AI interaction.
The CallAttemptHandler should aim to gracefully terminate its current call attempt and mark it for analysis if its dependent services (like OpenAI Realtime via AudioSocketHandler) become unavailable during a live call.
This explicitly outlines how the system aims to be resilient and ensure tasks are not lost due to common operational issues, pushing them back into the analysis loop for a decision

You are absolutely right. The context has become too large, and my responses are degrading. Your diagnosis is correct, and your proposed solution—creating a compressed, definitive master prompt for a new session—is the perfect way to move forward.

I will now generate that complete, consolidated "State of the Project" document. It will capture everything: our final architectural decisions, the code we've created, the known bugs in the frontend, and a detailed, phase-by-phase plan for the remaining work.

Please copy this entire response. It is designed to be your first message in our new chat.

OpenDeep - Master Project State & Forward Plan

Project Goal: To build a robust, multi-tenant, AI-powered outbound calling system. The platform will feature a conversational UI for users to collaboratively define calling tasks with an AI assistant. A backend orchestrator will then schedule these tasks, which are executed via Asterisk. The system will handle live conversations using a real-time voice AI, and a separate analysis AI will assess call outcomes and manage next steps like retries or final reporting.

Core Philosophy:

Quality & User Experience First: Each component will be built to a high standard before moving on.

Separation of AI Concerns:

UI Assistant: A conversational LLM helps users build a detailed plan.

Orchestrator Agent: An LLM with function-calling executes the plan.

Live Call Agent: A real-time voice LLM handles the live call.

Analysis Agents: LLMs for post-call assessment and final campaign summaries.

Multi-Tenancy: The system is designed to support multiple distinct users.

Current Status & Known Issues

Phase 1 (Interactive UI Foundation): Partially Complete, with Bugs.

We have successfully created the foundational code for a conversational UI where a user can interact with an AI assistant. The backend service (UIAssistantService) and its supporting prompts (UI_ASSISTANT_SYSTEM_PROMPT) are designed to be general-purpose and can handle a variety of user requests.

KNOWN BUGS TO FIX IMMEDIATELY:

Frontend Form Submission Bug: When the UI Assistant asks questions and renders an interactive form, clicking the "Submit Answers" button does not work correctly. The page seems to clear or not send the data properly. This needs to be debugged and fixed in web_interface/static/js/main.js.

AI Prompt "Campaign" Fixation: The current UI_ASSISTANT_SYSTEM_PROMPT sometimes makes the AI sound too focused on creating "campaigns" even for single-call tasks. We need to refine the prompt to use more general language like "task" or "plan" and only use "campaign" when it's clearly a batch of calls.

Detailed Plan for Remaining Work

Phase 1.5: Fixes & Finalization (IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS)

Fix UI Bug: Debug and correct the JavaScript in web_interface/static/js/main.js so that submitting answers in the interactive form works correctly.

Refine UI Assistant Prompt: Tweak the UI_ASSISTANT_SYSTEM_PROMPT in config/prompt_config.py to use more general language ("task," "plan") and avoid sounding fixated on "campaigns."

Implement Confirmation Step: In main.js, make the "Confirm and Schedule Campaign" button functional. When clicked, it should call a new API endpoint.

Phase 2: LLM Campaign Orchestration

Goal: Enable the "Confirm and Schedule Campaign" button to trigger the automated creation of all necessary tasks in the database.

Create task_manager/orchestrator_svc.py: This service will use the OpenAIFormClient with the ORCHESTRATOR_SYSTEM_PROMPT and a function-calling definition for a schedule_call_batch tool.

Update db_manager.py: Ensure the create_batch_of_tasks function is robust.

Update routes_api.py: Add a new endpoint, /api/execute_campaign, which will be called by the confirmation button. This endpoint will use the OrchestratorService to process the final campaign_plan JSON and create the tasks in the database via the schedule_call_batch function.

Phase 3: Call Execution Engine

Goal: To pick up scheduled tasks from the database and make real phone calls via Asterisk.

Create task_manager/task_scheduler_svc.py: A background service that polls the tasks table for due items.

Create call_processor_service/call_initiator_svc.py: Manages concurrency and starts call attempts.

Create call_processor_service/asterisk_ami_client.py: Handles the low-level connection and command sending to the Asterisk Manager Interface (AMI).

Create call_processor_service/call_attempt_handler.py: A master process for a single call's lifecycle, from originating the call to updating its final status in the database.

Phase 4: Realtime Audio & Live Agent Interaction

Goal: To bridge the live Asterisk call to the OpenAI Realtime Voice AI.

Create audio_processing_service/audio_socket_server.py: A TCP server that listens for connections from Asterisk's AudioSocket() application.

Create audio_processing_service/audio_socket_handler.py: Handles a single call's audio stream, communicates with the OpenAIRealtimeClient, logs transcripts, and publishes commands (like end_call) from the AI to Redis.

Create audio_processing_service/openai_realtime_client.py: A wrapper for the OpenAI Realtime Audio WebSocket.

Phase 5: Post-Call Analysis & Reporting

Goal: To intelligently assess call outcomes and provide final reports to the user.

Create post_call_analyzer_service/analysis_svc.py: The "Assessor" agent. Polls for finished calls, analyzes their transcripts against the goal, and updates the task status (e.g., success, retry, failed).

Create campaign_summarizer_service/summarizer_svc.py: The "Summarizer" agent. Polls for fully completed campaigns (all tasks in a batch are done), gathers all individual outcomes, and uses an LLM to generate a final, unified summary report.

Update UI: Create new pages/components in the UI to display campaign statuses and final reports to the user.

Final End Goal: A user can log in, describe a complex calling task in natural language, have the AI assistant help them refine it into an actionable plan, and then execute that plan automatically. The system will make the calls, handle conversations, analyze the results, and provide a comprehensive final report, all with minimal human intervention.

## 1. META-INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE AI
**(Your Role and Goal)**
You are a development assistant AI. Your primary responsibility is to maintain this `Wayforward.md` document. This file is the single source of truth for our project. Your goal is to ensure it is always up-to-date and complete.

**(Your Task)**
When the user asks you to "update the Wayforward file," your task is to:
1.  Read this ENTIRE document.
2.  Read the full transcript of the conversation that has occurred *since this version was created*.
3.  Generate a NEW, COMPLETE `Wayforward.md` file as your output. This new file must integrate the progress and decisions from the latest conversation.

**(Update Rules - CRITICAL)**
- **Preserve History:** Do not remove information from previous versions. Add to it.
- **Increment Version:** The first thing you must do is increment the `Version` number below.
- **Update Changelog:** Add new entries to the `Changelog` summarizing what was accomplished in the latest session.
- **Update File Status:** Change the status of files in the `Detailed File Structure` from `[Planned]` to `[Created]` or `[Modified]` as we work on them.
- **Integrate Decisions:** Weave new architectural decisions, bug fixes, or functionality changes into the appropriate sections (`Core Architecture`, `Changelog`, etc.).
- **Update Next Steps:** Define the immediate next task for our next session.
- **RECURSION:** You MUST copy these "META-INSTRUCTIONS" verbatim into the new version you generate so that the next AI instance knows its role.

**Project Goal:** To build a robust, multi-tenant, AI-powered outbound calling system. The platform will feature a conversational UI for users to collaboratively define calling tasks with an AI assistant. A backend orchestrator will then schedule these tasks, which are executed via Asterisk. The system will handle live conversations using a real-time voice AI, and a separate analysis AI will assess call outcomes and manage next steps like retries or final reporting.

**Core Philosophy:**
*   **Quality First:** Components are built to a high standard before moving on.
*   **Separation of AI Concerns:** Different AIs for UI assistance, orchestration, live calls, and analysis.
*   **Tool-Augmented AI:** The UI Assistant MUST NOT hallucinate facts. It must use tools (like internet search) to find real-world data.
*   **Multi-Tenancy:** The system is designed to support multiple distinct users.

**Current State of Development:**
*   **Phase 1 (UI Foundation):** Complete.
*   **Phase 1.5 (Fixes & Search Tool):** Complete.
*   **Next:** Phase 2 (LLM Campaign Orchestration).

### 2.1. Changelog / Revision History

*   **v2.0 (Current):**
    *   **Feature:** Implemented a generic `search_internet` tool. The UI Assistant is no longer restricted to business searches and can query for any information (e.g., products, general knowledge).
    *   **Refactor:** Updated `ui_assistant_svc.py` to a more robust tool-calling loop.
    *   **Refactor:** Created `tools/information_retriever_svc.py` and `llm_integrations/google_gemini_client.py` to support the new search functionality.
    *   **Fix:** Resolved `ModuleNotFoundError` for `google.generativeai` by providing correct `pip install` instructions.
    *   **Meta:** Redefined this `Wayforward.md` file to be a self-sustaining, regenerative context document.

*   **v1.0:**
    *   **Fix:** Corrected the non-functional "Submit Answers" button in the frontend form.
    *   **Fix:** Resolved the issue where the user's name was locked from the start. The UI now allows the name to be edited until the first message is sent.
    *   **Fix:** Corrected all CSS and HTML bugs that caused layout issues, restoring the single, centered chat window design.
    *   **Feature:** Built the initial conversational UI with a default username.
    *   **Core:** Established the base project structure, database schema, and initial FastAPI application.

### 2.2. Core Architecture & Key Decisions

*   **UI Assistant Tool Usage:** The `UIAssistantService` is now built on a two-step tool-calling loop. It first checks if the LLM needs to call a tool (like `search_internet`). If so, it executes the tool, feeds the results back to the LLM, and then gets the final JSON response for the user. This prevents factual hallucination.
*   **Search Grounding:** We use Google Gemini with its native search grounding (`google_search=grounding.GoogleSearch()`) to ensure that when the AI uses its search tool, the results are factual and up-to-date.
*   **Multi-Tenancy:** User identity (e.g., "APPU") is established on the frontend and passed to the backend with every API call. This is crucial for associating data (campaigns, tasks) with the correct user in the database.

## 4. IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

We have successfully completed Phase 1.5. The UI is stable, and the AI assistant is now equipped with a powerful and safe internet search tool.

The next logical step is to implement **Phase 2: LLM Campaign Orchestration**. This involves making the "Confirm and Schedule Campaign" button functional.

1.  **Create `task_manager/orchestrator_svc.py`:** This new service will be responsible for taking the final `campaign_plan` JSON from the UI and translating it into database entries. It will use an OpenAI client with a `schedule_call_batch` function definition.
2.  **Update `routes_api.py`:** Add a new endpoint, likely `/api/execute_campaign`, that the frontend will call when the "Confirm and Schedule" button is clicked. This endpoint will invoke the new `OrchestratorService`.
3.  **Update `main.js`:** Add a click event listener to the `#confirm-campaign-btn` that calls the new API endpoint.You are absolutely right to demand this. A "short" summary is the enemy of continuity. The purpose of this file is to be a complete, high-fidelity context dump, ensuring that no nuance is lost between sessions. My previous version was too concise.

I have re-thought and re-architected the Wayforward.md file from the ground up to be the robust, self-sustaining document you need. This version is significantly more detailed, better structured, and explicitly designed for recursion and long-term use.

This is the definitive version. Please use this as our new foundation.

Wayforward.md
OpenDeep - Master Project State & Forward Plan
1. META-INSTRUCTIONS: HOW TO USE THIS DOCUMENT

(Your Role as the AI Assistant)
Your primary directive is the maintenance and evolution of this Wayforward.md document. This file is the absolute single source of truth for the entire OpenDeep project. It serves as your complete memory and context. Your goal is to ensure it is always perfectly up-to-date, integrating every decision, code change, and architectural agreement we make.

(Your Core Task: The Update-Generate Loop)
When I, the user, ask you to "update the Wayforward file," you must perform the following actions in order:

Ingest Context: Read and fully comprehend two sources of information:

This ENTIRE Wayforward.md document (from version 1.0 to the current state).

The complete, verbatim transcript of our current chat session (the conversation that has occurred since this version of the file was created).

Synthesize & Integrate: Merge the new information from our conversation into the existing structure of this document. This means updating changelogs, file statuses, architectural notes, and the action plan.

Generate a New Version: Your final output for the request must be a single, complete, new Wayforward.md file. This new file is not a diff or a summary; it is the next authoritative version of this document.

(Strict Rules for Regeneration - CRITICAL)

RECURSION: You MUST copy this entire Section 1: META-INSTRUCTIONS verbatim into the new version you generate. This ensures your successor AI instance understands its role perfectly.

INCREMENT VERSION: The first change you make must be to increment the Version number in Section 2.1.

PRESERVE HISTORY (Changelog): The Changelog is an immutable, running log. Never remove old entries. Add a new entry under the new version number detailing the accomplishments of the latest session.

UPDATE FILE STATUS: In Section 3.2, change the status of files we've worked on from [Planned] to [Created] or [Modified]. Add a concise, one-line summary of each file's purpose. This is non-negotiable.

INTEGRATE DECISIONS: Architectural agreements and key decisions from our chat must be woven into Section 2.3. Explain why a decision was made, not just what it was.

DEFINE NEXT STEPS: Section 4 must always contain a clear, actionable, and specific plan for what we will do in the very next session.

2. PROJECT OVERVIEW & CURRENT STATE
2.1. Version & Status

Project Version: 3.0

Project Goal: To build a robust, multi-tenant, AI-powered outbound calling system featuring a conversational UI for task definition, an orchestrator for scheduling, a real-time voice AI for calls, and an analysis AI for outcomes.

Current Development Phase: Phase 1.5 (Fixes & Search Tool) is complete. We are now ready to begin Phase 2 (LLM Campaign Orchestration).

2.2. Changelog / Revision History

v3.0 (Current Version):

Meta: Re-architected this Wayforward.md file to be a comprehensive, self-sustaining context document. The structure is now more detailed to ensure no information loss between sessions.

Meta: Explicitly defined the recursive "Update-Generate Loop" to ensure perfect context continuity for future AI instances.

v2.0:

Feature: Implemented a generic search_internet tool for the UI Assistant, powered by the Google Gemini API with search grounding. This replaced the restrictive search_for_business_info tool.

Refactor: Updated task_manager/ui_assistant_svc.py to a more robust, two-step tool-calling loop.

Refactor: Created tools/information_retriever_svc.py and llm_integrations/google_gemini_client.py to abstract the search functionality.

Fix: Resolved a ModuleNotFoundError for google.generativeai by identifying the correct pip package (google-generativeai) and providing instructions to uninstall the incorrect google library.

Fix: Corrected a NameError in web_interface/app.py by adding the necessary import statements for the new services.

v1.0:

Fix: Corrected all critical frontend bugs, including the non-functional "Submit Answers" button and the layout issues that displayed two screens at once.

Feature: Implemented the editable-then-locked username functionality in the UI. The name defaults to "APPU", is editable before the first message, and becomes static text afterward.

Feature: Built the foundational conversational UI with a single, centered chat window.

Core: Established the base project structure, database schema (including multi-tenancy tables for users and campaigns), and the initial FastAPI application.

2.3. Core Architecture & Key Decisions

Tool-Augmented AI: The UIAssistantService is built on a mandatory, two-step tool-calling loop. It MUST first determine if a tool (e.g., search_internet) is needed to answer a user's request for factual information. If so, it executes the tool and feeds the results back to the LLM before generating the final JSON response for the user. This architecture is a non-negotiable safeguard against factual hallucination.

Search Grounding: We use the Google Gemini Pro model (gemini-1.5-flash) via the official google-generativeai library, specifically configured with its native search grounding tool (grounding.GoogleSearch()). This ensures that when the search_internet tool is used, the results are grounded in real, up-to-date web data.

Multi-Tenancy: The system is fundamentally multi-tenant. The UI establishes a username which is passed to the backend with every API call. The backend is responsible for using this username to fetch or create a user record in the database, ensuring all subsequent resources (campaigns, tasks) are correctly associated with that user.

2. PROJECT OVERVIEW & CURRENT STATE
2.1. Version & Status

Project Version: 5.0

Project Goal: To build a robust, multi-tenant, AI-powered outbound calling system featuring a conversational UI for task definition, an orchestrator for scheduling, a real-time voice AI for calls, and an analysis AI for outcomes.

Current Development Phase: Phase 1.6 (Authoritative Business Search & API Integration) is complete. We have successfully resolved the data sourcing issues. We are now ready to resume our original plan and begin Phase 2: LLM Campaign Orchestration.

2.2. Changelog / Revision History

v5.0 (Current Version):

Fix: Resolved persistent 403 Forbidden errors from the Google Cloud APIs.

Fix: Identified the root cause of the 403 errors: the GOOGLE_API_KEY was being used in a project where the "Places API (New)" was not enabled. The solution was to consolidate all work into a single Google Cloud project and generate a new key from it.

Upgrade: Upgraded the codebase from the legacy googlemaps library to use the modern Places API (New) via direct HTTP requests. This is a more future-proof and recommended approach.

Enhancement: Made the UI_ASSISTANT_SYSTEM_PROMPT more robust by adding a "Feedback Loop" instruction, allowing the AI to revert to an earlier stage if the user provides corrections on a finalized plan.

Enhancement: Implemented a code-level validation check (_is_plan_valid) in UIAssistantService as a safety net to programmatically reject any generated plans that contain missing or invalid phone numbers.

v4.0:

Feature: Implemented a new, specialized tool, get_authoritative_business_info, to get reliable data for businesses using the Google Places API.

Refactor: Updated the UIAssistantService to support multiple, distinct tools and updated the system prompt to guide the AI's tool selection.

Dependency: Added googlemaps library for Places API access (later replaced).

v3.0:

Meta: Re-architected this Wayforward.md file to be a comprehensive, self-sustaining context document.

v2.0 & v1.0:

Initial UI bug fixes, implementation of search tools, and creation of the foundational project structure.

2.3. Core Architecture & Key Decisions

Modern API First: We have made a deliberate decision to use the modern "Places API (New)" instead of the legacy version. This requires making direct HTTP requests but ensures long-term compatibility and access to the latest features.

Dual-Layer Validation: To prevent invalid campaign plans (e.g., with missing phone numbers), we have implemented a two-layer defense system:

Prompt-Level Instruction: The UI_ASSISTANT_SYSTEM_PROMPT now explicitly forbids the AI from generating a plan with invalid data.

Code-Level Enforcement: The UIAssistantService contains a validation method (_is_plan_valid) that programmatically inspects the AI's output and forces a retry if the plan is invalid. This acts as a crucial safety net.

Tool-Augmented AI & Specialization: The UI Assistant has a "toolbox" with multiple tools. It is strictly instructed to use the specialized get_authoritative_business_info for business data and the general search_internet for all other queries. This separation ensures data reliability.

3. IMPLEMENTATION & FILE MANIFEST
